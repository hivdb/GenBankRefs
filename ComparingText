Cosine similarity can be a good approach for comparing near-identical references, but it may not always capture subtle differences between titles that are largely the same. In your case, since the titles of references are expected to be quite similar, techniques that focus on minor variations (like typos or slight rewording) may provide better results.

Here are a few alternative approaches you can consider alongside cosine similarity:

1. Levenshtein Distance (Edit Distance)
What it does: This measures the number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, substitutions) needed to change one string into another. For highly similar titles, the Levenshtein distance will be small, indicating similarity.
Best use: When titles differ by small edits like a typo, rewording, or small changes in word order.
How to implement: You can use python-Levenshtein or difflib.SequenceMatcher in Python to compute this.
Example:

python
Copy code
import Levenshtein

title1 = "GenBank sequence submission from 2021"
title2 = "GenBank sequence submission in 2021"

distance = Levenshtein.distance(title1, title2)
print("Levenshtein Distance:", distance)
A small distance indicates near-identical references.

2. Jaccard Similarity
What it does: This compares the similarity between two sets of words. It measures the intersection of two sets (i.e., the common words) divided by their union. This approach is less sensitive to small changes in word order but can help identify similarity based on shared terms.
Best use: When you're looking for title similarity based on shared terms rather than exact character matches.
Example:

python
Copy code
def jaccard_similarity(str1, str2):
    set1, set2 = set(str1.split()), set(str2.split())
    return len(set1 & set2) / len(set1 | set2)

title1 = "GenBank sequence submission from 2021"
title2 = "GenBank sequence submission in 2021"

jaccard_sim = jaccard_similarity(title1, title2)
print("Jaccard Similarity:", jaccard_sim)
3. Fuzzy Matching (FuzzyWuzzy)
What it does: It uses Levenshtein distance under the hood but provides more intuitive similarity ratios for comparing short texts like titles.
Best use: When you want an easy-to-use library that simplifies finding similarity between two short texts (like titles).
Example:

python
Copy code
from fuzzywuzzy import fuzz

title1 = "GenBank sequence submission from 2021"
title2 = "GenBank sequence submission in 2021"

similarity = fuzz.ratio(title1, title2)
print("FuzzyWuzzy Similarity:", similarity)
This gives a percentage-based similarity score, which is more interpretable than cosine similarity or Levenshtein distance.

4. Cosine Similarity with N-Grams
What it does: You can use cosine similarity with n-grams (like 2-grams or 3-grams) to make it more sensitive to small differences in phrases or word order.
Best use: When you're dealing with slightly reworded or reordered titles that are still conceptually very similar.
You can modify TfidfVectorizer to use n-grams instead of single words:

python
Copy code
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

titles = ["GenBank sequence submission from 2021", "GenBank sequence submission in 2021"]

vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(ngram_range=(2, 3))  # Using 2-grams and 3-grams
tfidf_matrix = vectorizer.fit_transform(titles)

cosine_sim = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix[0:1], tfidf_matrix[1:2])
print("Cosine Similarity with N-Grams:", cosine_sim[0][0])
Which Approach to Choose?
Levenshtein Distance or Fuzzy Matching: If the titles are almost the same but might have small typos, character swaps, or very minor rewordings.
Jaccard Similarity: If you care more about the overlap of words in the title and less about exact word order.
Cosine Similarity with N-Grams: If you expect changes in word order or slightly more complex rewordings.
Since GenBank submissions typically involve structured titles with specific phrases, it might be helpful to combine these methods. For example, you could use fuzzy matching or Levenshtein distance to quickly filter out potential near-duplicates, and then verify those with cosine similarity.
