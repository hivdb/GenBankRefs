AB  - Hyalomma marginatum, a vector for the high-consequence pathogen, the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), needs particular attention due to its impact on public health. Although it is a known vector for CCHFV, its general virome is largely unexplored. Here, we report findings from a citizen science monitoring program aimed to understand the prevalence and diversity of tick-borne pathogens, particularly focusing on Hyalomma ticks in Hungary. In 2021, we identified one adult specimen of Hyalomma marginatum and subjected it to Illumina-based viral metagenomic sequencing. Our analysis revealed sequences of the uncharacterized Volzhskoe tick virus, an unclassified member of the class Bunyaviricetes. The in silico analysis uncovered key genetic regions, including the glycoprotein and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) coding regions. Phylogenetic analysis indicated a close relationship between our Volzhskoe tick virus sequences and other unclassified Bunyaviricetes species. These related species of unclassified Bunyaviricetes were detected in vastly different geolocations. These findings highlight the remarkable diversity of tick specific viruses and emphasize the need for further research to understand the transmissibility, seroreactivity or the potential pathogenicity of Volzhskoe tick virus and related species.

AB  - Wildlife serve as potential microbial reservoirs, accounting for approximately 70% of emerging infectious diseases. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), which causes Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in humans, is a highly pathogenic tick-borne virus prevalent in several parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe with high case fatality rates. Several CCHFV cases have been reported in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and Southern and Eastern Europe. The disease is endemic in several parts of western China, particularly Xinjiang. Ticks of the genus Hyalomma have been identified as a principal vector and reservoir for CCHFV, although other tick species may also have a crucial role in maintaining CCHFV in endemic regions. On infection, CCHF begins as a nonspecific febrile illness that can progress to severe hemorrhagic manifestations with a higher case fatality due to the unavailability of vaccines or other therapeutic agents. In this study, we collected tissue samples from a wild dead Chinese serow (Capricornis milneedwardsii) and three Naemorhedus griseuses from Deqin County, Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan, China, to investigate for contagious viruses that could be transmitted to humans. We identified a novel CCHFV strain, YNDQL-415G, in the liver tissue of a dead C. milneedwardsii. We performed nucleotide and amino acid sequence homology on the full-length viral genome. The results revealed significant homology between the viral S segment to that of the Africa1 strain, while the M and L segments showed similarity with the Asia CCHFV strain, indicating potential gene reassortment in the YNDQL-415G strain. The genetic characterization of a novel CCHFV strain from a dead C. milneedwardsii raises concerns about the possibility of a new zoonotic infection. A regular survey program is recommended to track the distribution of wild animals as well as the viruses they may transmit to humans and other domestic mammals in the region.

AB  - Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever orthonairovirus (CCHFV) is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus with a segmented genome and the causative agent of a severe Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) disease. The virus is transmitted mainly by tick species in Hyalomma genus but other ticks such as representatives of genera Dermacentor and Rhipicephalus may also be involved in virus life cycle. To improve our understanding of CCHFV adaptation to its tick species, we compared nucleotide composition and codon usage patterns among the all CCHFV strains i) which sequences and other metadata as locality of collection and date of isolation are available in GenBank and ii) which were isolated from in-field collected tick species. These criteria fulfilled 70 sequences (24 coding for S, 23 for M, and 23 for L segment) of virus isolates originating from different representatives of Hyalomma and Rhipicephalus genera. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed that Hyalomma- and Rhipicephalus-originating CCHFV isolates belong to phylogenetically distinct CCHFV clades. Analyses of nucleotide composition among the Hyalomma- and Rhipicephalus-originating CCHFV isolates also showed significant differences, mainly in nucleotides located at the 3rd codon positions indicating changes in codon usage among these lineages. Analyses of codon adaptation index (CAI), effective number of codons (ENC), and other codon usage statistics revealed significant differences between Hyalomma- and Rhipicephalus-isolated CCHFV strains. Despite both sets of strains displayed a higher adaptation to use codons that are preferred by Hyalomma ticks than Rhipicephalus ticks, there were distinct codon usage preferences observed between the two tick species. These findings suggest that over the course of its long co-evolution with tick vectors, CCHFV has optimized its codon usage to efficiently utilize translational resources of Hyalomma species.

AB  - Sporadic cases and outbreaks of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) have been documented across Pakistan since 1976; however, data regarding the diversity of CCHF virus (CCHFV) in Pakistan is sparse. We whole-genome sequenced 36 CCHFV samples collected from persons infected in Pakistan during 2017-2020. Most CCHF cases were from Rawalpindi (n = 10), followed by Peshawar (n = 7) and Islamabad (n = 4). Phylogenetic analysis revealed the Asia-1 genotype was dominant, but 4 reassorted strains were identified. Strains with reassorted medium gene segments clustered with Asia-2 (n = 2) and Africa-2 (n = 1) genotypes; small segment reassortments clustered with the Asia-2 genotype (n = 2). Reassorted viruses showed close identity with isolates from India, Iran, and Tajikistan, suggesting potential crossborder movement of CCHFV. Improved and continuous human, tick, and animal surveillance is needed to define the diversity of circulating CCHFV strains in Pakistan and prevent transmission.

AB  - Sampled ticks were screened for Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) using an assay that targets the nucleoprotein gene region of the S segment, a conserved region of the CCHFV genome. Minimum infection rates of 0.34% and 0.10% were obtained when testing pools of Hyalomma rufipes and Amblyomma variegatum, respectively. Next-generation sequencing and phylogenetic analysis showed that the S and L segments of the CCHFV isolate clustered with those of similar isolates of genotype III. However, analysis of the M segment showed that reassortment had occurred, causing this segment to cluster with those of isolates of genotype I, providing the first evidence of such an occurrence in Ghana.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), a tick-borne virus of the Orthonairovirus genus, persistently infects tick cells. It has been reported to establish persistent infection in non-human primates, but virological analysis has not yet been performed in human cells. Here, we investigated whether and how nairoviruses persistently infect human cells using Hazara orthonairovirus (HAZV), a surrogate model for CCHFV. We established a human cell line that was persistently infected with HAZV. Surprisingly, virions of persistently infected HAZV (HAZVpi) were not observed in the culture supernatants. There were five mutations (mut1, mut2, mut3, mut4, and mut5) in L protein of HAZVpi. Mutations in L protein of HAZVpi contribute to non-detection of virion in the supernatants. Lmut4 was found to cause low viral growth rate, despite its high polymerase activity. The low growth rate was restored by Lmut2, Lmut3, and Lmut5. The polymerase activity of Lmut1 was extremely low, and recombinant HAZV carrying Lmut1 (rHAZV/Lmut1) was not released into the supernatants. However, genomes of rHAZV/Lmut1 were retained in the infected cells. All mutations (Lmut1-5) found in L protein of HAZVpi were required for experimental reproduction of HAZVpi, and only Lmut1 and Lmut4 were insufficient. We demonstrated that point mutations in viral polymerase contribute to the establishment of persistent HAZV infection. Furthermore, innate immunity was found to be suppressed in HAZVpi-infected cells, which also potentially contributes to viral persistence. This is the first presentation of a possible mechanism behind how nairoviruses establish persistent infection in human cells. IMPORTANCE: We investigated whether and how nairoviruses persistently infect human cells, using Hazara orthonairovirus (HAZV), a surrogate model for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus. We established a human cell line that was persistently infected with HAZV. Five mutations were found in L protein of persistently infected HAZV (HAZVpi): mut1, mut2, mut3, mut4, and mut5. Among them, Lmut1 and Lmut4 restricted viral growth by low polymerase activity and low growth rate, respectively, leading to inhibition of viral overgrowth. The restriction of viral growth caused by Lmut1 and Lmut4 was compensated by other mutations, including Lmut2, Lmut3, and Lmut5. Each of the mutations found in L protein of HAZVpi was concluded to cooperatively modulate viral growth, which facilitates the establishment of persistent infection. Suppression of innate immunity also potentially contributes to virus persistence. This is the first presentation of a possible mechanism behind how nairoviruses establish persistent infection in human cells.

AB  - Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever orthonairovirus (CCHFV) is a tick-borne, risk group 4 pathogen that often causes a severe haemorrhagic disease in humans (CCHF) with high case fatality rates. The virus is believed to be maintained in a tick-vertebrate-tick ecological cycle involving numerous wild and domestic animal species; however the biology of CCHFV infection in these animals remains poorly understood. Here, we experimentally infect domestic sheep with CCHFV Kosovo Hoti, a clinical isolate representing high pathogenicity to humans and increasingly utilized in current research. In the absence of prominent clinical signs, the infection leads to an acute viremia and coinciding viral shedding, fever and markers for potential impairment in liver and kidney functions. A number of host responses distinguish the subclinical infection in sheep versus fatal infection in humans. These include an early reduction of neutrophil recruitment and its chemoattractant, IL-8, in the blood stream of infected sheep, whereas neutrophil infiltration and elevated IL-8 are features of fatal CCHFV infections reported in immunodeficient mice and humans. Several inflammatory cytokines that correlate with poor disease outcomes in humans and have potential to cause vascular dysfunction, a primary hallmark of severe CCHF, are down-regulated or restricted from increasing in sheep. Of particular interest, the detection of CCHFV RNA (including full-length genome) in a variety of sheep tissues long after the acute phase of infection indicates a widespread viral dissemination in the host and suggests a potentially long-term persisting impact of CCHFV infection. These findings reveal previously unrecognized aspects of CCHFV biology in animals.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is classified among top 10 priority pathogens by World Health Organization. CCHFV belongs to Bunyaviridae family and negative sense ssRNA genome composed of three RNA segments: L, M, and S. RNA viruses show higher mutation rate as compared to DNA viruses. To gain deeper understanding of impact of point mutations in CCHFV M and S segment, mutation profiling, homology modeling, and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation were performed. Structural glycoproteins (glycoprotein C [Gc] and glycoprotein N [Gn]) of CCHFV are important for host-virus interaction and genome packaging, whereas CCHFV nucleoprotein (NP) is crucial for viral replication. Hence, current study is focused on evaluation of eight mutations in structural glycoproteins (Gc: 7 and Gn: 1) of M segment and seven mutations in NP of S segment. All these mutations were highly frequent, with mutation frequency between 0.81 and 1.0 and found to be persistent in the recent strains of CCHFV. Solubility analysis predicted that selected point mutations reduce solubility of Gc protein and increase solubility of Gn and NP proteins. MD simulation study deciphered that A1046V and G1158E in Gc protein, I778T in Gn protein, and H195R in NP protein displayed large deviation and fluctuation, and affected intramolecular interactions. In conclusion, we observed that point mutations could impact structure, stability, and host-virus interaction of protein, and might lead to evolution of new strains for better survival and drug resistance.

AB  - Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is the most prevalent human tick-borne viral disease, endemic to the Balkans, Africa, Middle East and Asia. There are currently no licensed vaccines or effective antivirals against CCHF. CCHF virus (CCHFV) has a negative sense segmented tripartite RNA genome consisting of the small (S), medium (M) and large (L) segments. Depending on the segment utilised for genetic affiliation, there are up to 7 circulating lineages of CCHFV. The current lack of geographical representation of CCHFV sequences in various repositories highlights a requirement for increased CCHFV sequencing capabilities in endemic regions. We have optimised and established a multiplex PCR tiling methodology for the targeted enrichment of complete genomes of Europe 1 CCHFV lineage directly from clinical samples and compared its performance to a non-targeted enrichment approach on both short-read and long-read sequencing platforms. We have found a statistically significant increase in mapped viral sequencing reads produced with our targeted enrichment approach. This has allowed us to recover near complete S segment sequences and above 90% of the M and L segment sequences for samples with Ct values as high as 31.3. This study demonstrates the superiority of a targeted enrichment approach for recovery of CCHFV genomic sequences from samples with low virus titre. CCHFV is an important vector-borne human pathogen with wide geographical distribution. The validated methodology reported here adds value to front-line public health laboratories employing genomic sequencing for CCHFV Europe 1 lineage surveillance, particularly in the Balkan and Middle Eastern territories currently monitoring the spread of the pathogen. Tracking the genomic evolution of the virus across regions improves risk assessment and directly informs the development of diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.

AB  - Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is the causative agent of CCHF, a fatal viral haemorrhagic fever disease in humans. The maintenance of CCHFV in the ecosystem remains poorly understood. Certain tick species are considered as vectors and reservoirs of the virus. Diverse animals are suspected as amplifiers, with only scarce knowledge regarding rodents in virus epidemiology. In this study, serum samples from febrile patients, asymptomatic livestock (cattle, donkeys, sheep, and goats), and peridomestic rodents from Baringo (Marigat) and Kajiado (Nguruman) counties within the Kenyan Rift Valley were screened for acute CCHFV infection by RT-PCR and for CCHFV exposure by ELISA. RT-PCR was performed on all livestock samples in pools (5-7/pool by species and site) and in humans and rodents individually. CCHFV seropositivity was significantly higher in livestock (11.9%, 113/951) compared to rodents (6.5%, 6/93) and humans (5.9%, 29/493) (p = 0.001). Among the livestock, seropositivity was the highest in donkeys (31.4%, 16/51), followed by cattle (14.1%, 44/310), sheep (9.8%, 29/295) and goats (8.1%, 24/295). The presence of IgM antibodies against CCHFV was found in febrile patients suggesting acute or recent infection. CCHFV RNA was detected in four pooled sera samples from sheep (1.4%, 4/280) and four rodent tissues (0.83%, 4/480) showing up to 99% pairwise nucleotide identities among each other. Phylogenetic analyses of partial S segment sequences generated from these samples revealed a close relationship of 96-98% nucleotide identity to strains in the CCHFV Africa 3 lineage. The findings of this study suggest active unnoticed circulation of CCHFV in the study area and the involvement of livestock, rodents, and humans in the circulation of CCHFV in Kenya. The detection of CCHF viral RNA and antibodies against CCHFV in rodents suggests that they may participate in the viral transmission cycle.

AB  - Objective: We aim to investigate the species composition of ticks and the pathogen characteristics they carry in the Argun port area of the China-Russia border. Materials and Methods: Ticks were collected in surrounding grassland, mixed forest land, and other different habitats around the Argun port area at the Sino-Russian Border of Inner Mongolia in China in April 2019. The presence of 16 potential pathogens, including Yersinia Pestis, Francisella tularensis, Coxiella burnetii (Cb), Anaplasma sp. (Ap), spotted fever group rickettsiae (SFG Rk), Borrelia sp. (Bl), Leptospira, Bartonella spp., Babesia, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, Bhanja virus, West Nile Virus, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome bunyavirus, Hantaan virus, and bocavirus (boca) was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction. The DNA and amino acid sequences of tick-borne pathogens were compared for homology, and the phylogenetic trees were constructed by using Mega and Lasergene software. Results: A total of 210 ticks were collected and they belonged to three species: Dermacentor nuttalli, Ixodes persulcatus, and Haemaphysalis verticalis. Among them, 165 (78.57%) ticks tested positive for 5 pathogens, namely Ap, SFG Rk, Cb, Bl, and boca. Fifteen (7.14%) ticks were detected coinfection with two pathogens, and none were coinfected with three or more pathogens. Conclusion: This study shows the prevalence of at least five tick-borne pathogens in Argun, and there is a risk of coinfection by two pathogens in one tick. This study reveals the great importance of controlling tick-borne diseases in this region.

AB  - Background: Istanbul is one of the world's most densely populated metropolitan cities, with various geographical areas that possess distinct characteristics. These areas have different climates, vegetation, and host populations that can support the survival of diverse tick species. Turkey is a region with a high risk of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) disease, making it crucial to screen for this risk, especially in densely populated regions such as Istanbul and its surrounding areas. However, the presence of potential vectors for CCHF virus (CCHFV) in these areas has not been studied in the past 12 years. Materials and Methods: In this study, a total of 676 ticks were collected from 6 centers using the flagging and dragging method. Ticks were identified as Ixodes ricinus (7.85%), Ixodes spp. immature form (73.22%), Haemaphysalis parva (0.89%), Haemaphysalis inermis (0.15%), and Haemaphysalis spp. immature form (17.89%). Pooled samples were screened for the CCHFV genome (S segment) by RT-nested PCR. Results: A total of 14.28% of the samples were found as positive. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all the CCHFV sequences obtained from the positive samples were clustered in clade V: Europe/Turkey genogroup. Conclusion: This study suggests that ixodes spp. and Haemaphysalis spp. may have the potential to pose a biorisk for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever.

AB  - Orthonairovirus is a genus of viruses in the family Nairoviridae, order Bunyavirales, with a segmented circular RNA genome. They typically infect birds and mammals and are primarily transmitted by ectoparasites such as ticks. Four of nine Orthonairovirus genogroups can infect humans, with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus infections displaying case fatality rates up to 40%. Here, we discover and describe a novel Orthonairovirus as Cencurut virus (CENV). CENV was detected in 34 of 37 Asian house shrews (Suncus murinus) sampled in Singapore and in a nymphal Amblyomma helvolum tick collected from an infected shrew. Pairwise comparison of CENV S, M, and L segments had 95.0 to 100% nucleotide and 97.5 to 100% amino acid homology within CENV genomes, suggesting a diverse viral population. Phylogenetic analysis of the individual gene segments showed that CENV is related to Erve, Lamgora, Lamusara, and Thiafora viruses, with only 49.0 to 58.2% nucleotide and 41.7 to 61.1% amino acid homology, which has previously been detected in other shrew species from France, Gabon, and Senegal respectively. The high detection frequency suggests that CENV is endemic among S. murinus populations in Singapore. The discovery of CENV, from a virus family with known zoonotic potential, underlines the importance of surveillance of synanthropic small mammals that are widely distributed across Southeast Asia.

AB  - Background: Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) and Tacheng tick virus-1 (TcTV-1) are emerging tick-borne viruses that have been recently confirmed to be etiological agents of human disease in China. However, the ecology of JMTV and TcTV-1, especially their association with ticks in wildlife and livestock, remains largely unknown in Turkey. Materials and Methods: Eight hundred thirty-two tick specimens in 117 pools were collected in Turkey between 2020 and 2022 from wildlife (Miniopterus schreibersii and Rhinolophus hipposideros; n = 10, 1.2%; Testudo graeca; n = 50, 6%) and livestock (Ovis aries and Capra aegagrus hircus; n = 772, 92.7%). The specimens were individually screened for JMTV and TcTV-1 using nRT-PCR assays targeting the partial genes. Results: JMTV was detected in one Ixodes simplex pool and two Rhipicephalus bursa pools collected from central and Aegean provinces, respectively. TcTV-1 was identified in five Hyalomma aegyptium pools collected in Mediterranean provinces. No coinfection was detected in the tick pools. Maximum likelihood analysis of JMTV partial segment 1 sequences reveal that these sequences form a separate cluster together with viruses previously characterized in Turkey and the Balkan Peninsula. The phylogenetic analysis of the TcTV-1 nucleocapsid sequences indicates that they are closely related to viruses in ticks, sheep, cattle, and humans in China, but form a separate group among themselves. Conclusion: This study provides the first molecular evidence of TcTV-1 in Hy. aegyptium in Turkey. In addion, these findings indicate that JMTV and TcTV-1 extend ticks species and geographic distributions. Thus, multiregional surveillance in livestock and wildlife is needed to evaluate potential tick vectors and the human health impact of these viruses in Turkey.

AB  - A One Health cross-sectoral surveillance approach was implemented to screen biological samples from bats, pigs, and humans at high-risk interfaces for zoonotic viral spillover for five viral families with zoonotic potential in Viet Nam. Over 1600 animal and human samples from bat guano harvesting sites, natural bat roosts, and pig farming operations were tested for coronaviruses (CoVs), paramyxoviruses, influenza viruses, filoviruses and flaviviruses using consensus PCR assays. Human samples were also tested using immunoassays to detect antibodies against eight virus groups. Significant viral diversity, including CoVs closely related to ancestors of pig pathogens, was detected in bats roosting at the human-animal interfaces, illustrating the high risk for CoV spillover from bats to pigs in Viet Nam, where pig density is very high. Season and reproductive period were significantly associated with the detection of bat CoVs, with site-specific effects. Phylogeographic analysis indicated localized viral transmission among pig farms. Our limited human sampling did not detect any known zoonotic bat viruses in human communities living close to the bat cave and harvesting bat guano, but our serological assays showed possible previous exposure to Marburg virus-like (Filoviridae), Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus-like (Bunyaviridae) viruses and flaviviruses. Targeted and coordinated One Health surveillance helped uncover this viral pathogen emergence hotspot.

AB  - Bunyamwera virus is the prototype of the Bunyamwera serogroup, which belongs to the order Bunyavirales of the Orthobunyavirus genus in the Peribunyaviridae family. Bunyamwera is a negative-sense RNA virus composed of three segments S, M, and L. Genetic recombination is possible between members of this order as it is already documented. Additionally, it can lead to pathogenic or host range improvement, if it occurs with viruses of public health and agricultural importance such as Rift Valley fever virus and Crimea-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus. Here, we characterize five African Orthobunyavirus viruses from different geographical regions. Our results suggest that the five newly characterized strains are identified as Bunyamwera virus strains. Furthermore, two of the five strains sequenced in this study are recombinant strains, as fragments of their segments are carried by Ngari and Bunyamwera strains. Further investigations are needed to understand the functional impact of these recombinations.

AB  - Pakistan is an endemic country for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) and its Balochistan province is considered a hotspot region for circulation of the virus whereas sporadic cases have been reported from other parts of the country. Our study aims to investigate the genomic diversity of the CCHF virus circulating in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces of Pakistan. Between April to September 2022, 46 samples from suspected CCHF patients were tested, with 6 (13%) showing positive RT-PCR results. Among the positive cases, all were male, aged 14-48 years among which 4 were butchers. Three CCHF patients succumbed to the disease. The complete S-M-L-gene fragments of 4 positive samples were sequenced. The S and L segments belonged to the Asia-1 clade and clustered with regional strains from Iran, India, and Afghanistan. One M segment sequence grouped into Africa-2 along with those reported from India during 2016-2019. We report the detection of a reassorted virus (NIH-PAK-CCHF-03|2022) having Asia-1-Africa-2-Asia-1 (S-M-L) segment pattern for the first time from Pakistan. Mutational analysis showed M segments harboring eight mutations (T55A, S80P, T110I, T185A, T189A, A212T, and N239I/T) in the mucin-like domain, five mutations (D250N, T333S, I375V, M401I, A433T), four mutations (N545D, Y657F, K688R, and I824V) in GP38-domain, and three mutations (T1418N, A1431V, and G1449S) in Gc-domain. These findings highlight the significance of whole-genome sequencing of indigenous strains for a better understanding of the CCHFV evolution in Pakistan.

AB  - Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is the most widespread tick-borne viral haemorrhagic fever affecting humans, and yet a licensed drug against the virus (CCHFV) is still not available. While several studies have suggested the efficacy of ribavirin against CCHFV, current literature remains inconclusive. In this study, we have utilised next-generation sequencing to investigate the mutagenic effect of ribavirin on the CCHFV genome during clinical disease. Samples collected from CCHF patients receiving ribavirin treatment or supportive care only at Sivas Cumhuriyet University Hospital, Turkey, were analysed. By comparing the frequency of mutations in each group, we found little evidence of an overall mutagenic effect. This suggests that ribavirin, administered at the acute stages of CCHFV infection (at the World Health Organization-recommended dose) is unable to induce lethal mutagenesis that would cause an extinction event in the CCHFV population and reduce viremia.

AB  - On the African continent, a large number of arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) with zoonotic potential have been described, and yet little is known of most of these pathogens, including their actual distribution or genetic diversity. In this study, we evaluated as a proof-of-concept the effectiveness of the nonspecific sequencing technique sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) on third-generation sequencing techniques (MinION sequencing, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) by comparing the sequencing results from six different samples of arboviruses known to be circulating in Africa (Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), Dugbe virus (DUGV), Nairobi sheep disease virus (NSDV), Middleburg virus (MIDV) and Wesselsbron virus (WSLV)). All sequenced samples were derived either from previous field studies or animal infection trials. Using this approach, we were able to generate complete genomes for all six viruses without the need for virus-specific whole-genome PCRs. Higher Cq values in diagnostic RT-qPCRs and the origin of the samples (from cell culture or animal origin) along with their quality were found to be factors affecting the success of the sequencing run. The results of this study may stimulate the use of metagenomic sequencing approaches, contributing to a better understanding of the genetic diversity of neglected arboviruses.

AB  - Widespread in public databases, foreign contaminant sequences pose a substantial obstacle in genomic analyses. Such contamination in viral genome databases is also notorious but more complicated and often causes questionable results in various applications, particularly in virome-based virus detection. Here, we conducted comprehensive screening and identification of the foreign sequences hidden in the largest eukaryotic viral genome collections of GenBank and UniProt using a scrutiny pipeline, which enables us to rigorously detect those problematic viral sequences (PVSs) with origins in hosts, vectors, and laboratory components. As a result, a total of 766 nucleotide PVSs and 276 amino acid PVSs with lengths up to 6,605 bp were determined, which were widely distributed in 39 families with many involving highly public health-concerning viruses, such as hepatitis C virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, and filovirus. The majority of these PVSs are genomic fragments of hosts including humans and bacteria. However, they cannot simply be regarded as foreign contaminants, since parts of them are results of natural occurrence or artificial engineering of viruses. Nevertheless, they severely disturb such sequence-based analyses as genome annotation, taxonomic assignment, and virome profiling. Therefore, we provide a clean version of the eukaryotic viral reference data set by the removal of these PVSs, which allows more accurate virome analysis with less time consumed than with other comprehensive databases. IMPORTANCE High-throughput sequencing-based viromics highly depends on reference databases, but foreign contamination is widespread in public databases and often leads to confusing and even wrong conclusions in genomic analysis and viromic profiling. To address this issue, we systematically detected and identified the contamination in the largest viral sequence collections of GenBank and UniProt based on a stringent scrutiny pipeline. We found hundreds of PVSs that are related to hosts, vectors, and laboratory components. By the removal of them, the resulting data set greatly improves the accuracy and efficiency of eukaryotic virome profiling. These results refresh our knowledge of the type and origin of PVSs and also have warning implications for viromic analysis. Viromic practitioners should be aware of these problems caused by PVSs and need to realize that a careful review of bioinformatic results is necessary for a reliable conclusion.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) disease cases are registered annually in endemic regions of Kazakhstan. To study the prevalence of various Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) genotypes, a total of 694 ticks were collected from southern regions of Kazakhstan in 2021. Hyalomma marginatum (n = 323) (46.5%), Hyalomma anatolicum (n = 138) (19.9%), Hyalomma asiaticum (n = 126) (18.2%), Hyalomma scupense (n = 80) (11.5%) and Ixodes ricinus (n = 27) (3.9%) were collected using the standardized flagging technique from the environment. All the tick samples were analyzed for the presence of CCHFV RNA by RT-PCR. The CCHF-positive samples were found within three Hyalomma asiaticum and one Ixodes ricinus tick sample. For the first time in Kazakhstan, infection of the Ixodes ricinus tick with CCHFV was detected. The results of sequencing and analysis of the S-gene fragment showed that the Asia 1 and Asia 2 CCHF genotypes circulate in the southern regions of Kazakhstan. Viruses isolated in the Zhambyl and Turkestan regions are assigned to the Asia-2 genotype, whereas the virus isolated in the Kyzylorda region to the Asia-1 genotype.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Viral pathogens belonging to the order Bunyavirales pose a continuous background threat to global health, but the fact remains that they are usually neglected and their distribution is still ambiguously known. We aim to map the geographical distribution of Bunyavirales viruses and assess the environmental suitability and transmission risk of major Bunyavirales viruses in China. METHODS: We assembled data on all Bunyavirales viruses detected in humans, animals and vectors from multiple sources, to update distribution maps of them across China. In addition, we predicted environmental suitability at the 10 km × 10 km pixel level by applying boosted regression tree models for two important Bunyavirales viruses, including Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) and Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). Based on model-projected risks and air travel volume, the imported risk of RVFV was also estimated from its endemic areas to the cities in China. RESULTS: Here we mapped all 89 species of Bunyavirales viruses in China from January 1951 to June 2021. Nineteen viruses were shown to infect humans, including ten species first reported as human infections. A total of 447,848 cases infected with Bunyavirales viruses were reported, and hantaviruses, Dabie bandavirus and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) had the severest disease burden. Model-predicted maps showed that Xinjiang and southwestern Yunnan had the highest environmental suitability for CCHFV occurrence, mainly related to Hyalomma asiaticum presence, while southern China had the highest environmental suitability for Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) transmission all year round, mainly driven by livestock density, mean precipitation in the previous month. We further identified three cities including Guangzhou, Beijing and Shanghai, with the highest imported risk of RVFV potentially from Egypt, South Africa, Saudi Arabia and Kenya. CONCLUSIONS: A variety of Bunyavirales viruses are widely distributed in China, and the two major neglected Bunyavirales viruses including CCHFV and RVFV, both have the potential for outbreaks in local areas of China. Our study can help to promote the understanding of risk distribution and disease burden of Bunyavirales viruses in China, and the risk maps of CCHFV and RVFV occurrence are crucial to the targeted surveillance and control, especially in seasons and locations at high risk.

AB  - Long-read sequencing (LRS) approaches shed new light on the complexity of viral (Kakuk et al., 2021 [1]; Boldogkői et al., 2019 [2]; Depledge et a., 2019 [3]), bacterial (Yan et al., 2018 [4]) and eukaryotic (Tilgner et al., 2014 [5]) transcriptomes. Emerging RNA viruses are zoonotic (Woolhouse et al., 2016 [6]) and create public health problems, e.g. influenza pandemic caused by H1N1 virus in (Fraser et al., 2009 [7]), as well as the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (Kim et al., 2020 [8]). In this study, we carried out nanopore sequencing for generating transcriptomic data valuable for structural and kinetic profiling of six important human pathogen RNA viruses, the H1N1 subtype of Influenza A virus (IVA), the Zika virus (ZIKV), the West Nile virus (WNV), the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), the Coxsackievirus [group B serotype 5 (CVB5)] and the Vesicular stomatitis Indiana virus (VSIV), and the response of host cells upon viral infection. The raw sequencing data were filtered during basecalling and only high quality reads (Qscore ≥ 7) were mapped to the appropriate viral and host genomes. Length distribution of sequencing reads were assessed and statistics of data were plotted by the ReadStat.4 python script. The datasets can be used to profile the transcriptomic landscape of RNA viruses, provide information for novel gene annotations, can serve as resource for studying the virus-host interactions, and for the analysis of RNA base modifications. These datasets can be used to compare the different sequencing techniques, library preparation approaches, bioinformatics pipelines, and to analyze the RNA profiles of viruses with small RNA genomes.

AB  - In this report, we present new data on the diversity and geographical distribution of genetic variants in Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) in Russia. Partial S, M, and L segment sequences of the CCHFV genome were obtained from 500 serum samples from CCHF patients and 103 pools of ticks collected in the south of the European region of Russia in 2007-2017. The investigated viral strains belonged to the lineages Europe 1 (596 samples), Africa 3 (1 sample) and a new genetic lineage, Europe 3 (6 samples). The Russian CCHFV strains of the Europe 1 lineage formed four subgroups (Va-Vd) correlated with the geographical site of virus isolation. Segment reassortment events between strains of different subgroups within lineage Europe 1 were revealed. The complete S, M and L genome segments of 18 CCHFV strains belonging to different subgroups of the Europe 1 lineage and the complete S segments of 3 strains of the Europe 3 lineage and 1 strain of the Africa 3 lineage were sequenced. The analysis of the geographical distribution of CCHFV genetic variants in southern Russia revealed local viral populations with partially overlapping boundaries.

AB  - CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats), an ancient defense mechanism used by prokaryotes to cleave nucleic acids from invading viruses and plasmids, is currently being harnessed by researchers worldwide to develop new point-of-need diagnostics. In CRISPR diagnostics, a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) containing a "spacer" sequence that specifically complements with the target nucleic acid sequence guides the activation of a CRISPR effector protein (Cas13a, Cas12a or Cas12b), leading to collateral cleavage of RNA or DNA reporters and enormous signal amplification. CRISPR function can be disrupted by some types of sequence mismatches between the spacer and target, according to previous studies. This poses a potential challenge in the detection of variable targets such as RNA viruses with a high degree of sequence diversity, since mismatches can result from target variations. To cover viral diversity, we propose in this study that during crRNA synthesis mixed nucleotide types (degenerate sequences) can be introduced into the spacer sequence positions corresponding to viral sequence variations. We test this crRNA design strategy in the context of the Cas13a-based SHERLOCK (specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking) technology for detection of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), a biosafety level 4 pathogen with wide geographic distribution and broad sequence variability. The degenerate-sequence CRISPR diagnostic proves functional, sensitive, specific and rapid. It detects within 30-40 minutes 1 copy/μl of viral RNA from CCHFV strains representing all clades, and from more recently identified strains with new mutations in the CRISPR target region. Also importantly, it shows no cross-reactivity with a variety of CCHFV-related viruses. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that the degenerate sequence-based CRISPR diagnostic is a promising tool of choice for effective detection of highly variable viral pathogens.

AB  - Human cases of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) were first detected in Spain in 2016. National human and animal health authorities organized a large, multidisciplinary study focusing on ticks as sentinels to determine the nationwide distribution of ticks with CCHF virus. Ticks were collected from animals and vegetation, samples pooled (12,584 ticks; 4,556 pools), and molecular methods used to look for the virus. We detected the virus in 135 pools from most of the regions studied, indicating that it is widespread in Spain. We found sequences of CCHF virus genotypes I, III, and IV in the tick species collected, most commonly in Hyalomma lusitanicum, suggesting this tick has a prominent role in the virus's natural cycle. The red deer (Cervus elaphus) was the host that most frequently yielded positive ticks. Our study highlights the need for larger studies in Spain to ascertain the complete risk to public health.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a tick-borne arbovirus that can cause bleeding and death in humans. The mortality rate in humans is between 5 and 30%. The pathogen is prevalent in more than 30 countries in the world. In China, the CCHFV has been reported in Xinjiang province but not in Inner Mongolia province yet. In this report, we phylogenetically analyzed a new CCHFV strain, HANM-18, identified from Hyalomma asiaticum and Hyalomma dromedarii collected in Alxa Left Banner and Alxa Right Banner of Inner Mongolia, China. Complete sequences of CCHFV were obtained by the nested PCR technique and used for phylogenetic analysis of the identity and evolutionary relationship with other CCHFV strains. Our results showed that the S and L fragments of the HANM-18 strain had a high percentage of identity with strains in Xinjiang, China. The M fragment was significantly homologous to South African isolates. In addition, these data also indicate that the HANM-18 strain may have been prevalent in northwestern Inner Mongolia for many years. This discovery will be helpful in CCHF prevention and control in Inner Mongolia, and it also adds new evidence to the epidemiology of CCHF in China.

AB  - Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is endemic in Uganda, yet its epidemiology remains largely uncharacterized. To better understand its occurrence within Uganda, case reports of patients hospitalized with CCHF between 2013 and 2019 were reviewed. Further, genome sequences of CCHF-positive RNA obtained during this period were determined for phylogenetic comparisons. We found that a total of 32 cases (75% males; CFR, 31.2%), aged between 9 to 68 years, were reported during the study period. Most cases were detected during July to December of each outbreak year (81.2%; P < 0.01) and were located along the "cattle corridor" (68.7%, P = 0.03). The most common presenting symptoms were fever (93.8%), hemorrhage (81.3%), headache (78.1%), fatigue (68.8%), vomiting (68.8%), and myalgia (65.6%). In five patients for whom hematological data were available, varied abnormalities were observed including thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, anemia, lymphopenia, lymphocytosis, polycythemia, and microcytosis. About 56.3% (P = 0.47) of patients reported tick bites or exposure to livestock as their potential source of infection. Person-to-person transmission was suspected for two cases. Using unbiased metagenomics, we found that the viral S- and L- segments have remained conserved in Africa 2 clade since the 1950s. In contrast, the M segment split into two geographically interspersed clades; one that belongs to Africa 2 and another that is ancestral to Africa 1 and 2. Overall, this data summarizes information on the history and clinical presentation of human CCHF in Uganda. Importantly, it identifies vulnerable populations as well as temporal and geographic regions in Uganda where surveillance and control interventions could be focused.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a severe disease of humans caused by CCHF virus (CCHFV), a biosafety level (BSL)-4 pathogen. Ticks of the genus Hyalomma are the viral reservoir, and they represent the main vector transmitting the virus to its hosts during blood feeding. We have previously shown that CCHFV can persistently infect Hyalomma-derived tick cell lines. However, the mechanism allowing the establishment of persistent viral infections in ticks is still unknown. Hazara virus (HAZV) can be used as a BSL-2 model virus instead of CCHFV to study virus/vector interactions. To investigate the mechanism behind the establishment of a persistent infection, we developed an in vitro model with Hyalomma-derived tick cell lines and HAZV. As expected, HAZV, like CCHFV, persistently infects tick cells without any sign of cytopathic effect, and the infected cells can be cultured for more than 3 years. Most interestingly, we demonstrated the presence of short viral-derived DNA forms (vDNAs) after HAZV infection. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the antiretroviral drug azidothymine triphosphate could inhibit the production of vDNAs, suggesting that vDNAs are produced by an endogenous retrotranscriptase activity in tick cells. Moreover, we collected evidence that vDNAs are continuously synthesized, thereby downregulating viral replication to promote cell survival. Finally, vDNAs were also detected in CCHFV-infected tick cells. In conclusion, vDNA synthesis might represent a strategy to control the replication of RNA viruses in ticks allowing their persistent infection. IMPORTANCE Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is an emerging tick-borne viral disease caused by CCHF virus (CCHFV). Ticks of the genus Hyalomma can be persistently infected with CCHFV representing the viral reservoir, and the main vector for viral transmission. Here we showed that tick cells infected with Hazara virus, a nonpathogenic model virus closely related to CCHFV, contained short viral-derived DNA forms (vDNAs) produced by endogenous retrotranscriptase activity. vDNAs are transitory molecules requiring viral RNA replication for their continuous synthesis. Interestingly, vDNA synthesis seemed to be correlated with downregulation of viral replication and promotion of tick cell viability. We also detected vDNAs in CCHFV-infected tick cells suggesting that they could represent a key element in the cell response to nairovirus infection and might represent a more general mechanism of innate immunity against RNA viral infection.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus is one among the major zoonosis viral diseases that use the Hyalomma ticks as their transmission vector to cause viral infection to the human and mammalian community. The fatality of infectious is high across the world especially in Africa, Asia, Middle East, and Europe. This study regarding codon usage bias of S, M, and L segments of the CCHF virus pertaining to the host Homo sapiens, reveals in-depth information about the evolutionary characteristics of CCHFV. Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU), Effective number of codons (ENC) were calculated, to determine the codon usage pattern in each segment. Correlation analysis between Codon adaptation index (CAI), GRAVY (Hydrophobicity), AROMO (Aromaticity), and nucleotide composition revealed bias in the codon usage pattern. There was no strong codon bias found among any segments of the CCHF virus, indicating both the factors i.e., natural selection and mutational pressure shapes the codon usage bias.

AB  - The increasing burden of tick-borne orthonairovirus infections, such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, is becoming a global concern for public health. In the present study, we identify a novel orthonairovirus, designated Yezo virus (YEZV), from two patients showing acute febrile illness with thrombocytopenia and leukopenia after tick bite in Hokkaido, Japan, in 2019 and 2020, respectively. YEZV is phylogenetically grouped with Sulina virus detected in Ixodes ricinus ticks in Romania. YEZV infection has been confirmed in seven patients from 2014-2020, four of whom were co-infected with Borrelia spp. Antibodies to YEZV are found in wild deer and raccoons, and YEZV RNAs have been detected in ticks from Hokkaido. In this work, we demonstrate that YEZV is highly likely to be the causative pathogen of febrile illness, representing the first report of an endemic infection associated with an orthonairovirus potentially transmitted by ticks in Japan.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Thirty-four CCHF cases (17 fatal; 17 survived) were confirmed from Gujarat state, India during the year 2019. We aimed to find out the viral load, antibody kinetics, cytokine profile and phylogenetic analysis between fatal and non- fatal cases. METHODS: Thirty four cases were included in this study. Blood and urine samples were collected from all the cases on the day of admission to hospital. Non-fatal cases were followed weekly for understanding the profile of viral kinetics, anti-CCHFV IgM and IgG antibodies. We also quantified the cytokines in both fatal and non-fatal cases. For epidemiological correlation, livestock were screened for anti-CCHF IgG antibodies and the tick pool specimens were tested by real time RT-PCR. Virus isolation was attempted on tick pools and human specimens and phylogenetic analysis performed on human and ticks complete genome sequences. RESULTS: CCHF cases were detected throughout year in 2019 with the peak in August. Out of 34 cases, eight secondary CCHF cases were reported. Cases were predominantly detected in males and in 19-45 years age group (55.88%). The persistence of viremia was observed till 76th POD (post onset date) in one case whereas anti-CCHFV IgM and IgG was detected amongst these cases from the 2nd and 20th POD respectively. Positivity observed amongst livestock and tick pools were was 21.57% and 7.4% respectively. The cytokine analysis revealed a significant increase in the level of serum IL-6, IL-10 and IFN-γ during the acute phase of the infection, but interestingly IL-10 lowered to normal upon clearance of the virus in the clinically recovered case. Fatal cases had high viral RNA copy numbers. Bleeding from one or two mucosal sites was significantly associated with fatality (OR-16.47;p-0.0034 at 95% CI). We could do CCHF virus isolation from two cases. Phylogenetic analysis revealed circulation of re-assortment of Asian-West African genotypes in humans and ticks. CONCLUSIONS: The persistence of CCHF viral RNA was detected till 76th POD in one of the survivors. The circulation of a re-assortment Asian-West African genotype in a CCHF case is also reported first time from India.

AB  - Arthropod-borne infections are a medical and economic threat to humans and livestock. Over the last three decades, several unprecedented viral outbreaks have been recorded in the Western part of the Arabian Peninsula. However, little is known about the circulation and diversity of arthropod-borne viruses in this region. To prepare for new outbreaks of vector-borne diseases, it is important to detect which viruses circulate in each vector population. In this study, we used a metagenomics approach to characterize the RNA virome of ticks infesting dromedary camels (Camelus dromedaries) in Makkah province, Saudi Arabia. Two hundred ticks of species Hyalomma dromedarii (n = 196) and Hyalomma impeltatum (n = 4) were collected from the Alkhurma district in Jeddah and Al-Taif city. Virome analysis showed the presence of several tick-specific viruses and tick-borne viruses associated with severe illness in humans. Some were identified for the first time in the Arabian Peninsula. The human disease-associated viruses detected included Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic fever virus and Tamdy virus (family Nairoviridae), Guertu virus (family Phenuiviridae), and a novel coltivirus that shares similarities with Tarumizu virus, Tai forest reovirus and Kundal virus (family Reoviridae). Furthermore, Alkhurma hemorrhagic virus (Flaviviridae) was detected in two tick pools by specific qPCR. In addition, tick-specific viruses in families Phenuiviridae (phleboviruses), Iflaviridae, Chuviridae, Totiviridae and Flaviviridae (Pestivirus) were detected. The presence of human pathogenetic viruses warrants further efforts in tick surveillance, xenosurveillence, vector control, and sero-epidemiological investigations in human and animal populations to predict, contain and mitigate future outbreaks in the region.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a fatal disease caused by Nairovirus classified within the Bunyaviridae family. The virus is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected ticks or direct contact with viremic animals or humans. The current study aimed to detect the virus genome in ticks from Khorasan Razavi Province. METHODS: One hundred hard ticks were collected randomly from 100 sheep in four different areas of the province. Collected ticks were kept alive and identified. All the ticks were analyzed for the presence of CCHF virus genome using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR). RESULTS: The identified ticks were belonging to Hyalomma marginatum (16% female and 6% male), Rhipicephalus turanicus (52% female and 25% male), and Dermacentor raskemensis (1%). The CCHF virus genome was found in Hyalomma marginatum (5% male from Taibad and Sabzevar region and 1% female from Taibad). Genetic analysis of the virus genome isolated from two regions (Sabzevar and Taibad) showed 100% identity. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that CCHF should be regarded as a risk-borne infection in this province. Therefore, special health management is needed to control this disease.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne zoonotic disease of human that caused by CCHF virus. To study the epidemiological distribution of CCHFV, 2183 tick samples were collected from sheep, goats, cattle and buffalo of different livestock farms of ten districts of Punjab province of Pakistan. Detection of CCHFV was done using enzyme link immunosorbent assay (ELISA) after proper identification of tick samples. The partial S-segment of CCHFV from ELISA positive tick samples was amplified by PCR and sequenced to determine the genotype of CCHFV. Out of2183 collected tick samples, 1913 ticks belonged to 5 species of genus Hyalomma as H. antolicum (48%), H. marginatum (30.2%), H. rufipes (10.82%), H. impressum (5.43%) and H. dromedarii (5.27%). While 270 ticks belonged to 3 species of genus Rhipicephalus as R. microplus (44.8%), R. sanguineus (32.22%) and R. turanicus (24.8%). The overall antigenic prevalence of CCHFV was found to be 12.13% in collected tick samples and 21 tick pools were sequenced for partial S-segment of CCHFV. All of the 21 tick pools were clustered in genotype IV (Asia-1). The highest prevalence of CCHFV was found in district Chakwal (24.13%) followed by Mianwali (23.68%), Rawalpindi (23.07%), Attock (20.0%), Rajanpur (10.52%) and Lahore (8.33%). In positive tick pools, the highest prevalence of CCHFV antigen was found in H. antolicum (39.6%) followed by H. marginatum (30.18%), H. rufipes (13.2%), H. impressum (3.77%), H. dromedarii (1.88%), R. microplus (5.66%) and R. sanguineus (5.66%). The current study confirms the presence of CCHFV in the ticks population of Punjab. The CCHF virus present in Punjab belongs to Asia-1 genotype. It is important to control the tick infestation of the animals present in these areas. So that the transmission cycle of CCHF can be inhibited.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is the most geographically widespread of the tick-borne viruses. However, African strains of CCHFV are poorly represented in sequence databases. In addition, almost all sequence data collected to date have been obtained from cases of human disease, while information regarding the circulation of the virus in tick and animal reservoirs is severely lacking. Here, we characterize the complete coding region of a novel CCHFV strain, detected in African blue ticks (Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) decoloratus) feeding on cattle in an abattoir in Kampala, Uganda. These cattle originated from a farm in Mbarara, a major cattle-trading hub for much of Uganda. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that the newly sequenced strain belongs to the African genotype II clade, which predominantly contains the sequences of strains isolated from West Africa in the 1950s, and South Africa in the 1980s. Whilst the viral S (nucleoprotein) and L (RNA polymerase) genome segments shared >90% nucleotide similarity with previously reported genotype II strains, the glycoprotein-coding M segment shared only 80% nucleotide similarity with the next most closely related strains, which were derived from ticks in Western India and Northern China. This genome segment also displayed a large number of non-synonymous mutations previously unreported in the genotype II strains. Characterization of this novel strain adds to our limited understanding of the natural diversity of CCHFV circulating in both ticks and in Africa. Such data can be used to inform the design of vaccines and diagnostics, as well as studies exploring the epidemiology and evolution of the virus for the establishment of future CCHFV control strategies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a widespread tick-borne viral disease caused by the Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV). CCHFV has been implicated in severe viral haemorrhagic fever outbreaks. During the summer of 2016, the first two cases with genotype III (Africa 3) were reported in Spain. The first objective of our study was to determine the presence of CCHFV among patients with febrile illness during the spring and summer periods in 2017 and 2018. Finally, we perform a phylogenetic analysis to determine the genotype of the virus. METHODOLOGY: We prospectively evaluated patients aged 18 years and older who came to the emergency department at the Salamanca's University Hospital (HUS) with fever. Specific IgM and IgG antibodies against CCHFV by ELISA and one immunofluorescence assay against two different proteins (nucleoprotein and glycoprotein C) was done. Moreover, molecular detection by Real Time PCR was performed in all collected samples. A phylogenetic analysis was carried out to genetically characterize CCHFV detected in this study. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A total of 133 patients were selected. The mean age was 67.63 years and 60.9% were male. One-third of the patients presented an acute undifferentiated febrile illness. Three patients had anti-CCHFV IgG antibodies, suggesting a previous infection. One patient had anti-CCHFV IgM antibodies and a confirmatory RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the virus corresponds to the European genotype V. This patient came to the emergency department at HUS in August 2018 presenting an acute febrile syndrome with thrombopenia and liver impairment. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a new circulation of European genotype V CCHFV in Spain. Moreover, this study suggests that CCHFV is an identifiable cause of febrile illness of unknown origin in Spain. Thus, CCHF could be suspected in patients with fever, liver damage, and/or haemorrhagic disorders, particularly in people with risk activities who present in the spring or summer.

AB  - The genus Orthonairovirus, which is part of the family Nairoviridae, includes the important tick-transmitted pathogens Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and Nairobi sheep disease virus, as well as many other poorly characterized viruses found in ticks, birds and mammals(1,2). In this study, we identified a new orthonairovirus, Songling virus (SGLV), from patients who reported being bitten by ticks in Heilongjiang Province in northeastern China. SGLV shared similar genomic and morphological features with orthonairoviruses and phylogenetically formed a unique clade in Tamdy orthonairovirus of the Nairoviridae family. The isolated SGLV induced cytopathic effects in human hepatoma cells in vitro. SGLV infection was confirmed in 42 hospitalized patients analyzed between 2017 and 2018, with the main clinical manifestations being headache, fever, depression, fatigue and dizziness. More than two-thirds (69%) of patients generated virus-specific antibody responses in the acute phase. Taken together, these results suggest that this newly discovered orthonairovirus is associated with human febrile illness in China.

AB  - Currently, next generation sequencing (NGS) is the mainly used approach for identification and monitorization of viruses with a potential public health threat in clinical and environmental samples. To facilitate detection in NGS, the sequence-independent, single-primer-amplification (SISPA) is an effective tool for enriching virus sequences. We performed a preliminary assessment of SISPA-nanopore sequencing as a potential approach for screening tick-borne viruses in six specimens with detectable Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) and Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) sequences. A comparison of unbiased NGS and SISPA followed by nanopore sequencing was carried out in 4 specimens with single and pooled ticks. The approach was further used for genome sequencing in culture-grown viruses. Overall, total/virus-specific read counts were significantly elevated in cell culture supernatants in comparison to single or pooled ticks. Virus genomes could be successfully characterized by SISPA with identities over 99%. Genome coverage varied according to the segment and total read count. Base calling errors were mainly observed in tick specimens and more frequent in lower viral loads. Culture-grown viruses were phylogenetically-related to previously-reported local viruses. In conclusion, the SISPA + nanopore sequencing was successful in generating data comparable to NGS and will provide an effective tool for broad-range virus detection in ticks.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne viral disease in the old continents, in many countries south of the 50 °North Parallel. The agent is known to be the most prevalent and major cause of severe and fatal human hemorrhagic diseases among the tick-borne viruses, and is the second most widespread of all medically critical arboviruses following dengue. Members of the Hyalomma genus are mainly involved in the natural transmission of the CCHF virus (CCHFV); of those, H. marginatum is known to be the primary vector of the disease in the Western Palaearctic. In general, epidemiological studies have been based on serological detections in the hosts and/or virus screening of ticks collected from the hosts. To the best of our knowledge, only a few studies have been carried out to screen the virus in unfed, questing field ticks. Nevertheless, detection of the virus in questing ticks is known to be a crucial parameter to determine the possible vector roles of the ticks and to understand the ecological dynamics of related diseases. In this study, 200 (75 males,125 females) questing H. marginatum adults collected from the field in nine villages in Thrace, located in the European part of Turkey, were screened individually for CCHFV using nested PCR. As a result, 103 (51.5 %) ticks were determined as positive with various strains of CCHFV. High positivity in questing vectors in a region where a significantly lower number of human cases have been encountered suggests that there should be some region-specific drivers that are effective in the natural dynamics of the disease. Detailed etiological and epidemiological studies are needed to reveal the possible reason for this unexpected discrepancy.

AB  - Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a tick-borne virus causing Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), a disease reported to have a high fatality rate in numerous countries. The virus is geographically widespread due to its vector, and numerous wild and domestic animals can develop asymptomatic infection. Serological and limited molecular evidence of CCHFV has previously been reported in Camelus dromedarius (the dromedary, or one-humped camel) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In this study, 238 camel samples were screened for CCHFV RNA where 16 camel samples were positive for CCHFV by RT-PCR. Analysis of full-length CCHFV genome sequences revealed a novel lineage in camels from the UAE, and potential reassortment of the M segment of the genome.

AB  - Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is the causative agent of the severe tick-borne, often fatal, zoonotic Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), which is widely distributed worldwide. The CCHFV transmission to humans occurs through tick bite, crushing of engorged ticks or contact with infected host blood. Previously, CCHFV genotype Africa III was reported in Spain. Given the emergence of CCHF and the role of ticks in pathogen maintenance and transmission, we investigated the presence and genotype identity of the virus in tick species parasitizing abundant wild host species in south-western Spain. A total of 613 adult ticks were collected from hunter-harvested wild ungulates in twenty locations throughout south-western Spain. Ticks were identified, nucleic acids were extracted, RNA was analysed by a nested RT-PCR targeting CCHFV S segment, and the amplicons were sequenced. According to the 212-bp sequence amplified, the presence of CCHFV human genotype Europe V was detected in Hyalomma lusitanicum and Dermacentor marginatus ticks collected from red deer, fallow deer and Eurasian wild boar in different locations from south-western Spain. Genotype Africa IV was also detected in a H. lusitanicum tick collected from a red deer. The detection of CCHFV in different tick species collected from various wild hosts and localities provided strong evidence of widespread CCHFV presence in the region, suggesting that the circulation of the virus in Spain requires more attention. Additionally, the identification of the CCHFV genotype Europe V in ticks suggested that its introduction in Spain was probably from Eastern Europe.

AB  - Being an endemic country for Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), this study aimed to explore the genetic diversity of CCHF virus (CCHFV) detected in Pakistan during 2019. Serum samples from patients with clinical signs of hemorrhagic fever attending tertiary care hospitals in Pakistan were tested for CCHFV RNA using real-time PCR at Department of Virology, National Institute of Health. The partial S-gene fragments were directly sequenced to determine the prevailing CCHFV genotypes and their molecular epidemiology in Pakistan. During January-December 2019, 280 samples from suspected CCHF patients were tested and 28 (10%) were found positive on real-time PCR. Positive cases were detected from 14 districts and across all four provinces of Pakistan with majority reported during August-September. The mean age of CCHFV positive patients was 37.25 years (range 5-65 years) with a high frequency in males (92.8%; n = 26) and a case fatality rate of 40.7% was observed. Phylogenetic analysis showed that S- segment of 2019 PAK CCHFV strains (n = 13) belonged to Asia-1 genotype and clustered with regional strains from Iran, Oman, and Afghanistan. We conclude that Asia-1 genotype of CCHF virus remains endemic in Pakistan. Our findings emphasize to establish a laboratory based surveillance program to monitor the disease burden and identify outbreak hotspots for effective control.

AB  - Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a zoonotic viral disease presenting with fever and hemorrhagic manifestations in humans. After several outbreaks of CCHF being reported from Gujarat since 2011 till 2019 and from Rajasthan in 2014 and 2015, the present study reports the CCHF outbreak which was recorded from five human cases in three districts Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, and Sirohi of Rajasthan state since August 2019 till November 2019. A high percent of positivity was recorded in livestock animal samples for the CCHFV IgG antibody. CCHF virus (CCHFV) positive human blood samples and Hyalomma tick pool samples were sequenced using next-generation sequencing method. Two different M segment genotypes, encoding glycoprotein precursor, were identified from tick pools in the study: first from Asian and second from African lineage. The L gene (polymerase) and the S gene (nucleocapsid) clustered in the Asian lineage. The present study illustrates the existence of two different CCHFV lineages being circulating within the Hyalomma tick pools in the Rajasthan state, India. We also observed 3.56% amino acid changes between the death and the survived case of CCHFV in the M gene. This report also sets an alarm to enhance human, tick and livestock surveillance in other districts of Rajasthan and nearby states of India. Biosafety measures, barrier nursing along with the availability of personal protective equipment and ribavirin drug will always be a mainstay in preventing nosocomial infection for proper case management.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a tick-borne virus that can cause a hemorrhagic fever in humans, with a case fatality rate of up to 40%. Cases of CCHFV have been reported in Africa, Asia, and southern Europe; and recently, due to the expanding range of its vector, autochthonous cases have been reported in Spain. Although it was discovered over 70 years ago, our understanding of the pathogenesis of this virus remains limited. We used RNA-Seq in two human liver cell lines (HepG2 and Huh7) infected with CCHFV (strain IbAr10200), to examine kinetic changes in host expression and viral replication simultaneously at 1 and 3 days post infection. Through this, numerous host pathways were identified that were modulated by the virus including: antiviral response and endothelial cell leakage. Notably, the genes encoding DDX60, a cytosolic component of the RIG-I signalling pathway and OAS2 were both shown to be dysregulated. Interestingly, PTPRR was induced in Huh7 cells but not HepG2 cells. This has been associated with the TLR9 signalling cascade, and polymorphisms in TLR9 have been associated with poor outcomes in patients. Additionally, we performed whole-genome sequencing on CCHFV to assess viral diversity over time, and its relationship to the host response. As a result, we have demonstrated that through next-generation mRNA deep-sequencing it is possible to not only examine mRNA gene expression, but also to examine viral quasispecies and typing of the infecting strain. This demonstrates a proof-of-principle that CCHFV specimens can be analyzed to identify both the virus and host biomarkers that may have implications for prognosis.

AB  - We obtained a Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) isolate, following inoculation of a tick pool with detectable Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) RNA. We subsequently screened 7223 ticks, representing 15 species in five genera, collected from various regions in Anatolia and eastern Thrace, Turkey. Moreover, we tested specimens from various patient cohorts (n = 103), and canine (n = 60), bovine (n = 20) and avian specimens (n = 65). JMTV nucleic acids were detected in 3.9% of the tick pools, including those from several tick species from the genera Rhipicephalus and Haemaphysalis, and Hyalomma marginatum, the main vector of CCHFV in Turkey. Phylogenetic analysis supported two separate clades, independent of host or location, suggesting ubiquitous distribution in ticks. JMTV was not recovered from any human, animal or bird specimens tested. Near-complete viral genomes were sequenced from the prototype isolate and from three infected tick pools. Genome topology and functional organization were identical to the members of Jingmen group viruses. Phylogenetic reconstruction of individual viral genome segments and functional elements further supported the close relationship of the strains from Kosovo. We further identified probable recombination events in the JMTV genome, involving closely-related strains from Anatolia or China.

AB  - Due to anthropic environmental changes, vector-borne diseases are emerging worldwide. Ticks are known vectors of several pathogens of concern among humans and animals. In recent decades, several examples of tick-borne emerging viral diseases have been reported (Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Powassan virus, encephalitis virus, heartland virus, severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus). Unfortunately, few studies addressing the presence of viruses in wild ticks have been carried out in South America. With the aim of detecting flaviviruses and orthobunyaviruses in ticks, we carried out molecular detection in wild ticks collected in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. No Flavivirus-positive ticks were detected; however, we detected activity of Orthobunyavirus in 8 Amblyomma tick specimens. One of those individuals was positive for Bunyamwera orthobunyavirus, which represents the first report of this virus among ticks in South America. Further studies related to the ecology of zoonotic diseases are needed to increase knowledge of this topic, including attempts at viral isolation, full genome sequencing and biological characterization. In this way, we will obtain a better picture of the real risk of ticks as a vector for viral diseases for humans and animals on our continent, where no tick-borne viral disease is known to occur.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: People in Western Africa suffer greatly from febrile jaundice, which is caused by a variety of pathogens. However, yellow fever virus (YFV) is the only pathogen under surveillance in Sierra Leone owing to the undeveloped medical and public health system there. Most of the results of YFV identification are negative. Elucidation of the pathogen spectrum is required to reduce the prevalence of febrile jaundice. METHODS: In the present study, we used Ion Torrent semiconductor sequencing to profile the pathogen spectrum in archived YFV-negative sera from 96 patients in Sierra Leone who presented with unexplained febrile jaundice. RESULTS: The most frequently identified sequencing reads belonged to the following pathogens: cytomegalovirus (89.58%), Epstein-Barr virus (55.21%), hepatitis C virus (34.38%), rhinovirus (28.13%), hepatitis A virus (20.83%), coxsackievirus (10.42%), Ebola virus (8.33%), hepatitis E virus (8.33%), lyssavirus (4.17%), leptospirosis (4.17%), chikungunya virus (2.08%), Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (1.04%), and hepatitis B virus (1.04%). CONCLUSION: The distribution of sequencing reads suggests a broader spectrum of pathogens for consideration in clinical diagnostics and epidemiological surveillance in Sierra Leone.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a serious disease with a high fatality rate reported in many countries. The first case of CCHF in Oman was detected in 1995 and serosurveys have suggested widespread infection of humans and livestock throughout the country. METHODOLOGY: Cases of CCHF reported to the Ministry of Health (MoH) of Oman between 1995 and 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Diagnosis was confirmed by serology and/or molecular tests in Oman. Stored RNA from recent cases was studied by sequencing the complete open reading frame (ORF) of the viral S segment at Public Health England, enabling phylogenetic comparisons to be made with other S segments of strains obtained from the region. FINDINGS: Of 88 cases of CCHF, 4 were sporadic in 1995 and 1996, then none were detected until 2011. From 2011-2017, incidence has steadily increased and 19 (23.8%) of 80 cases clustered around Eid Al Adha. The median (range) age was 33 (15-68) years and 79 (90%) were male. The major risk for infection was contact with animals and/or butchering in 73/88 (83%) and only one case was related to tick bites alone. Severe cases were over-represented: 64 (72.7%) had a platelet count < 50 x 109/L and 32 (36.4%) died. There was no intrafamilial spread or healthcare-associated infection. The viral S segments from 11 patients presenting in 2013 and 2014 were all grouped in Asia 1 (IV) lineage. CONCLUSIONS: CCHF is well-established throughout Oman, with a single strain of virus present for at least 20 years. Most patients are men involved in animal husbandry and butchery. The high mortality suggests that there is substantial under-diagnosis of milder cases. Preventive measures have been introduced to reduce risks of transmission to animal handlers and butchers and to maintain safety in healthcare settings.

AB  - In 2011, ticks were collected from livestock following an outbreak of Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in Gujarat state, India. CCHF-negative Hyalomma anatolicum tick pools were passaged for virus isolation, and two virus isolates were obtained, designated Karyana virus (KARYV) and Kundal virus (KUNDV), respectively. Traditional reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) identification of known viruses was unsuccessful, but a next-generation sequencing (NGS) approach identified KARYV and KUNDV as viruses in the Reoviridae family, Orbivirus and Coltivirus genera, respectively. Viral genomes were de novo assembled, yielding 10 complete segments of KARYV and 12 nearly complete segments of KUNDV. The VP1 gene of KARYV shared a most recent common ancestor with Wad Medani virus (WMV), strain Ar495, and based on nucleotide identity we demonstrate that it is a novel WMV strain. The VP1 segment of KUNDV shares a common ancestor with Colorado tick fever virus, Eyach virus, Tai Forest reovirus, and Tarumizu tick virus from the Coltivirus genus. Based on VP1, VP6, VP7, and VP12 nucleotide and amino acid identities, KUNDV is proposed to be a new species of Coltivirus Electron microscopy supported the classification of KARYV and KUNDV as reoviruses and identified replication morphology consistent with other orbi- and coltiviruses. The identification of novel tick-borne viruses carried by the CCHF vector is an important step in the characterization of their potential role in human and animal pathogenesis.IMPORTANCE Ticks and mosquitoes, as well Culicoides, can transmit viruses in the Reoviridae family. With the help of next-generation sequencing (NGS), previously unreported reoviruses such as equine encephalosis virus, Wad Medani virus (WMV), Kammavanpettai virus (KVPTV), and, with this report, KARYV and KUNDV have been discovered and characterized in India. The isolation of KUNDV and KARYV from Hyalomma anatolicum, which is a known vector for zoonotic pathogens, such as Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Babesia, Theileria, and Anaplasma species, identifies arboviruses with the potential to transmit to humans. Characterization of KUNDV and KARYV isolated from Hyalomma ticks is critical for the development of specific serological and molecular assays that can be used to determine the association of these viruses with disease in humans and livestock.

AB  - Post-translational modification of host and viral proteins by ubiquitin (Ub) and Ub-like proteins, such as interferon stimulated gene product 15 (ISG15), plays a key role in response to infection. Viruses have been increasingly identified that contain proteases possessing deubiquitinase (DUB) and/or deISGylase functions. This includes viruses in the Nairoviridae family that encode a viral homologue of the ovarian tumor protease (vOTU). vOTU activity was recently demonstrated to be critical for replication of the often-fatal Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, with DUB activity suppressing the type I interferon responses and deISGylase activity broadly removing ISG15 conjugated proteins. There are currently about 40 known nairoviruses classified into fourteen species. Recent genomic characterization has revealed a high degree of diversity, with vOTUs showing less than 25% amino acids identities within the family. Previous investigations have been limited to only a few closely related nairoviruses, leaving it unclear what impact this diversity has on vOTU function. To probe the effects of vOTU diversity on enzyme activity and specificity, we assessed representative vOTUs spanning the Nairoviridae family towards Ub and ISG15 fluorogenic substrates. This revealed great variation in enzymatic activity and specific substrate preferences. A subset of the vOTUs were further assayed against eight biologically relevant di-Ub substrates, uncovering both common trends and distinct preferences of poly-Ub linkages by vOTUs. Four novel X-ray crystal structures were obtained that provide a biochemical rationale for vOTU substrate preferences and elucidate structural features that distinguish the vOTUs, including a motif in the Hughes orthonairovirus species that has not been previously observed in OTU domains. Additionally, structure-informed mutagenesis provided the first direct evidence of a second site involved in di-Ub binding for vOTUs. These results provide new insight into nairovirus evolution and pathogenesis, and further enhances the development of tools for therapeutic purposes.

PD  - Mar
AB  - Hazara nairovirus (HAZV) is a trisegmented RNA virus most closely related to Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) in the order Bunyavirales The terminal roughly 20 nucleotides (nt) of its genome ends are highly complementary, similar to those of other segmented negative-strand RNA viruses (sNSV), and act as promoters for RNA synthesis. These promoters contain two elements: the extreme termini of both strands (promoter element 1 [PE1]) are conserved and virus specific and are found bound to separate sites on the polymerase surface in crystal structures of promoter-polymerase complexes. The following sequences (PE2) are segment specific, with the potential to form double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), and the latter aspect is also important for promoter activity. Nairovirus genome promoters differ from those of peribunyaviruses and arenaviruses in that they contain a short single-stranded region between the two regions of complementarity. Using a HAZV minigenome system, we found the single-stranded nature of this region, as well as the potential of the following sequence to form dsRNA, is essential for reporter gene expression. Most unexpectedly, the sequence of the PE2 dsRNA appears to be equally important for promoter activity. These differences in sNSV PE2 promoter elements are discussed in light of our current understanding of the initiation of RNA synthesis.IMPORTANCE A minigenome system for HAZV, closely related to CCHFV, was used to study its genome replication. HAZV genome ends, like those of other sNSV, such as peribunyaviruses and arenaviruses, are highly complementary and serve as promoters for genome synthesis. These promoters are composed of two elements: the extreme termini of both 3' and 5' strands that are initially bound to separate sites on the polymerase surface in a sequence-specific fashion and the following sequences with the potential to anneal but whose sequence is not important. Nairovirus promoters differ from the other sNSV cited in that they contain a short single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) region between the two elements. The single-stranded nature of this region is an essential element of the promoter, whereas its sequence is unimportant. The sequence of the following complementary region is unexpectedly also important, a possible rare example of sequence-specific dsRNA recognition.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a tick-borne pathogen that causes severe disease in humans. CCHFV is widely distributed in more than 30 countries and distinct regions, which means that it poses a serious threat to human health. The nucleocapsid protein (NP) encoded by the CCHFV S gene is the primary detectable antigen in infected cells, which makes it an important viral antigen and a clinical diagnostic target. In this study, the modified biosynthetic peptide (BSP) method was used to identify the fine epitopes on the N- and C- terminals of NP from the CCHFV YL04057 strain using rabbit antiserum against CCHFV-NP. Nine epitopes were identified: E1a (178NLILNRGG185), E1b (184GGDENP189), E2 (352PLKWGKK358), E3 (363FADDS367), E4 (399NPDDAA404), E5a (447DIVASEHL454), E5b (452EHLLHQSL459), E6 (464SPFQNAY470) and E7 (475NATSANII482). Western blotting analysis showed that each epitope interacted with the positive serum of sheep that had been naturally infected with CCHFV. Amino acid sequence alignment between each epitope and their homologous proteins showed that they were almost 100% conserved among 12 CCHFV sequences from different lineages, except for epitopes E1a, E1b and E2. Three-dimensional structural modeling analysis showed that all identified epitopes were located on the surface of the NP "head" domain. This study identified fine epitopes on the N- and C- terminals of NP, which will increase the understanding of the structure and function of NP, and it could lay the foundation for the design and development of a CCHFV multi-epitope peptide vaccine and detection antigen.

AB  - The Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus (CCHFV) is a tick-borne virus, whose viral RNA consists of S, L, and M segments. The virus is migrating through the ticks with animals and migratory birds and the geographical distribution can be investigated based on genetic analysis. To better understand the connection between the seropositivity and the mortality rate, the key factor could be the temporal and spatial analysis of the different strains. In this study, serum samples (n = 26) were selected from CCHFV RNA-positive patients and subjected to sequence analysis of the gene regions encoding the S segments. According to the neighbor-joining analysis, the obtained partial sequences were linked to the European strain. The strains were closely related to Turkey-Kelkit06, Turkey 200310849 viruses, and viruses from Russia and Kosovo. The comparison with previously analyzed isolates from the GenBank showed 95%-99% sequence similarity. The isolates in phylogenetic branches were divided into two groups. AST, platelet, and APTT levels were found significantly higher in Group 2 compared to Group 1. Nucleotide differences can be prognostic factor in CCHF disease. Increasing CCHF cases not originating from local isolates were circulating strains imported from different neighboring countries of Turkey. The results show new evidence to the emerging threat of the CCHF disease.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever orthonairovirus (CCHFV) is a tick-borne virus which causes severe disease in humans with fatality cases up to 30%. We investigated the genetic and evolutionary characteristics of CCHFV in Kosovo, in particular in humans and found that different virus variants of genotype V circulate, with Turkey as a possible origin for the progenitor of southern European CCHF outbreaks. Phylogenetic analyses also revealed a single introduction event and in situ evolution of CCHFV in this country. The viral metagenomics revealed a more abundant virome in the fatal CCHF cases and the presence of a novel tick-borne segmented RNA virus belonging to the recently discovered Jingmenvirus group which raises questions about the potential pathogenic effect of this novel virus on human and animal health.

AB  - The use of ribavirin to treat Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) infection has been controversial, based on uncertainties about its antiviral efficacy in clinical case studies. We studied the effect of ribavirin treatment on viral populations in a recent case by deep-sequencing analysis of plasma samples obtained from a CCHFV-infected patient before, during, and after a 5-day regimen of ribavirin treatment. The CCHFV load dropped during ribavirin treatment, and subclonal diversity (transitions) and indels increased in viral genomes during treatment. Although the results are based on a single case, these data demonstrate the mutagenic effect of ribavirin on CCHFV in vivo.

The strain clusters into lineage Europe 2 representing the second available whole-genome sequenced isolate of this lineage. CCHFV IgG antibodies were detected in 8 of 19 goats of the farm. Currently CCHFV is not associated with disease in mammals other than humans. Studies in animal models are needed to investigate the pathogenicity level of lineage Europe 2 and compare it with that of other lineages.

AB  - The Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), a member of the genus Orthonairovirus and family Nairoviridae, is transmitted by ticks and causes severe hemorrhagic disease in humans. To study the epidemiology of CCHFV in different ecosystems in Xinjiang, China, a total of 58,932 ticks were collected from Tarim Basin, Junggar Basin, Tianshan Mountain, and Altai Mountain from 2014 to 2017. Hyalomma asiaticum asiaticum was the dominant tick species in Tarim and Junggar basins, whereas Dermacentor nuttalli and Hyalomma detritum were found in Tianshan Mountain and Altai Mountain, respectively. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of the CCHFV small (S) genome segment was used for the molecular detection. The CCHFV-positive percentage was 5.26%, 6.85%, 1.94%, and 5.56% in Tarim Basin, Junggar Basin, Tianshan Mountain, and Altai Mountain, respectively. Sequences of the S segment were used for phylogenetic analysis and the results showed that the newly identified CCHFV strains belonged to two clades. Our study confirms that H. asiaticum asiaticum is the major vector of CCHFV in desert habitats which is consistent with previous studies, and also suggests that H. detritum and D. nuttalli are emerging vectors for CCHFV in Xinjiang. Moreover, this study reports the presence of CCHFV in the mountain habitat of Xinjiang for the first time, suggesting that future surveillance of CCHFV should also include mountainous areas.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) caused by the CCHF virus (CCHFV) is a tick-borne natural focal disease with a mortality rate of approximately 50%. CCHFV is widely prevalent in Africa, southern Asia, the Middle East, and southeast Europe. CCHF outbreaks have been reported previously in Xinjiang province, China, especially in its southern region. Epidemiological surveys conducted on ticks and animals have revealed the presence of CCHFV strains in ticks, rodents, and infected individuals from cities and counties in southern Xinjiang. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the Chinese CCHFV strains belong to one genotype, based on complete sequences of the S segments of its negative-stranded RNA genome. The present study reports two new CCHFV strains isolated from Hyalomma asiaticum asiaticum ticks collected from Fukang City and Wujiaqu City in the northern region of Xinjiang. Viral characteristics and their evolutionary relationships were analyzed through metagenomic and reverse-transcription PCR analyses; these analyses indicated that the genotype of both strains was different from that of other Chinese strains. Furthermore, previous reports of CCHFV in Xinjiang were reviewed and phylogenetic analyses were performed. CCHFV was found to prevail in Fukang City in Junggar Basin for more than 20 years, and that Fukang City and Wujiaqu City are considered natural reservoirs of different genotypes of CCHFV strains. Our findings facilitate the understanding of CCHFV distribution in Xinjiang province and provide insights into the evolutionary relationships among Chinese CCHFV strains.

AB  - Phylodynamics of Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) genotype V in South Russia was analyzed using 244 partial (452-571 nt) sequences in all three genomic segments and 38 complete genomic sequences. Despite increased number of sequences, the Russian lineage of the European genotype V (commonly termed GtVa) was distinct from GtV isolates from Turkey and the Balkan countries. No geographic pattern was observed in phylogenetic subgrouping of CCHFV within South Russia. Identical isolates could be found at distant locations spaced by hundreds of kilometers, while relatively divergent viruses circulated in the same region. Full genome analysis indicated that reassortment events within GtVa occurred every few decades (median half-life of a non-reassortant node 30-40 years) and involved M and S segments. Therefore, in South Russia CCHFV represents a highly dynamic population of frequently reassorting viruses.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a negative-sense, single stranded RNA virus with a three-segmented genome that belongs to the genus Nairovirus within the family Bunyaviridae. CCHFV uses Hyalomma ticks as a vector to infect humans with a wide range of clinical signs, from asymptomatic to Zika-like syndrome. Despite significant progress in genomic analyses, the influences of viral relationships with different hosts on overall viral fitness, survival, and evading the host's immune systems remain unknown. To better understand the evolutionary characteristics of CCHFV, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the codon usage pattern in 179 CCHFV strains by calculating the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU), effective number of codons (ENC), codon adaptation index (CAI), and other indicators. The results indicate that the codon usage bias of CCHFV is relatively low. Several lines of evidence support the hypothesis that a translation selection factor is shaping codon usage pattern in this virus. A correspondence analysis (CA) showed that other factors, such as base composition, aromaticity, and hydrophobicity may also be involved in shaping the codon usage pattern of CCHFV. Additionally, the results from a comparative analysis of RSCU between CCHFV and its hosts suggest that CCHFV tends to evolve codon usage patterns that are comparable to those of its hosts. Furthermore, the selection pressures from Homo sapiens, Bos taurus, and Ovis aries on the CCHFV RSCU patterns were dominant when compared with selection pressure from Hyalomma spp. vectors. Taken together, both natural selection and mutation pressure are important for shaping the codon usage pattern of CCHFV. We believe that such findings will assist researchers in understanding the evolution of CCHFV and its adaptation to its hosts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We describe the development and evaluation of a novel method for targeted amplification and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)-based identification of viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) agents and assess the feasibility of this approach in diagnostics. METHODOLOGY: An ultrahigh-multiplex panel was designed with primers to amplify all known variants of VHF-associated viruses and relevant controls. The performance of the panel was evaluated via serially quantified nucleic acids from Yellow fever virus, Rift Valley fever virus, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus, Ebola virus, Junin virus and Chikungunya virus in a semiconductor-based sequencing platform. A comparison of direct NGS and targeted amplification-NGS was performed. The panel was further tested via a real-time nanopore sequencing-based platform, using clinical specimens from CCHF patients. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The multiplex primer panel comprises two pools of 285 and 256 primer pairs for the identification of 46 virus species causing hemorrhagic fevers, encompassing 6,130 genetic variants of the strains involved. In silico validation revealed that the panel detected over 97% of all known genetic variants of the targeted virus species. High levels of specificity and sensitivity were observed for the tested virus strains. Targeted amplification ensured viral read detection in specimens with the lowest virus concentration (1-10 genome equivalents) and enabled significant increases in specific reads over background for all viruses investigated. In clinical specimens, the panel enabled detection of the causative agent and its characterization within 10 minutes of sequencing, with sample-to-result time of less than 3.5 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Virus enrichment via targeted amplification followed by NGS is an applicable strategy for the diagnosis of VHFs which can be adapted for high-throughput or nanopore sequencing platforms and employed for surveillance or outbreak monitoring.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is transmitted to humans mainly through the bite of infected ticks. In Greece, only one clinical case has been observed, in 2008, but the seroprevalence in humans is relatively high (4.2%). To have a first insight into the circulation of CCHFV in Greece, 2000 ticks collected from livestock during 2012-2014 were tested. CCHFV was detected in 36 of the 1290 (2.8%) tick pools (1-5 ticks per pool). Two genetic lineages were identified: Europe 1 and Europe 2. Most Europe 1 sequences were obtained from Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato ticks, while most Europe 2 sequences were recovered from Rhipicephalus bursa ticks. The number of collected Hyalomma marginatum ticks (the principal vector of CCHFV) was low (0.5% of ticks) and all were CCHFV negative. Since it is not known how efficient ticks of the Rhipicephalus genus are as vectors of the virus, laboratory studies will be required to explore the role of Rhipicephalus spp. ticks in CCHFV maintenance and transmission.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a severe tick-borne disease caused by CCHF virus (CCHFV). Ticks in the genus Hyalomma are the main vectors and reservoirs of CCHFV. In Spain, CCHFV was first detected in Hyalomma ticks from Cáceres in 2010. Subsequently, two autochthonous CCHF cases were reported in August 2016. In this study, we describe the characterization of the CCHFV genome directly from Hyalomma lusitanicum collected in Cáceres in 2014. Phylogenetic analyses reveal a close relationship with clade III strains from West Africa, with an estimated divergence time of 50 years. The results of this work suggest that CCHFV has been circulating in Spain for some time, and most likely originated from West Africa.

AB  - Albania is a Balkan country endemic for Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF). It was shown previously that CCHF virus (CCHFV) sequences from Albanian patients cluster into Europe 1 clade. Aim of the present study was to test for CCHFV ticks collected in several regions of Albania, and to determine the genetic lineage(s) of the CCHFV strains in relation with their geographic distribution. A total of 726 ticks (366 Hyalomma marginatum, 349 Rhipicephalus bursa and 11 Rhipicephalus sanguineus) collected from livestock during 2007-2014 were included in the study. Thirty of 215 (13.9%) tick pools were positive for CCHFV. Lineage Europe 1 was detected in H. marginatum ticks collected in the endemic region of Albania, while lineage Europe 2 was detected mainly in R. bursa ticks in various regions of the country. Both genetic lineages were detected in the CCHF endemic area (northeastern Albania), while only Europe 2 lineage was detected in the south of the country. A higher genetic diversity was seen among Europe 2 than Europe 1 Albanian sequences (mean distance 3.7% versus 1%), suggesting a longer evolution of AP92-like strains (Europe 2) in their tick hosts. The present study shows that besides CCHFV lineage Europe 1, lineage Europe 2 is also present in Albania. Combined with results from recent studies, it is concluded that lineage Europe 2 is widely spread in the Balkans and Turkey, and is associated mainly with R. bursa ticks (at least in this region). Its pathogenicity and impact to the public health remain to be elucidated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ticks are involved with the transmission of several viruses with significant health impact. As incidences of tick-borne viral infections are rising, several novel and divergent tick- associated viruses have recently been documented to exist and circulate worldwide. This study was performed as a cross-sectional screening for all major tick-borne viruses in several regions in Turkey. Next generation sequencing (NGS) was employed for virus genome characterization. Ticks were collected at 43 locations in 14 provinces across the Aegean, Thrace, Mediterranean, Black Sea, central, southern and eastern regions of Anatolia during 2014-2016. Following morphological identification, ticks were pooled and analysed via generic nucleic acid amplification of the viruses belonging to the genera Flavivirus, Nairovirus and Phlebovirus of the families Flaviviridae and Bunyaviridae, followed by sequencing and NGS in selected specimens. RESULTS: A total of 814 specimens, comprising 13 tick species, were collected and evaluated in 187 pools. Nairovirus and phlebovirus assays were positive in 6 (3.2%) and 48 (25.6%) pools. All nairovirus sequences were closely-related to the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) strain AP92 and formed a phylogenetically distinct cluster among related strains. Major portions of the CCHFV genomic segments were obtained via NGS. Phlebovirus sequencing revealed several tick-associated virus clades, including previously-characterized Antigone, Lesvos, KarMa and Bole tick viruses, as well as a novel clade. A wider host range for tick-associated virus strains has been observed. NGS provided near-complete sequences of the L genomic segments of Antigone and KarMa clades, as well as Antigone partial S segment. Co- infections of CCHFV and KarMa or novel phlebovirus clades were detected in 2.1% of the specimens. CONCLUSIONS: Widespread circulation of various tick-associated phlebovirus clades were documented for the first time in Anatolia. Genomes of CCHFV AP92 strains were identified in previously unexplored locations. NGS provided the most detailed genomic characterization of the Antigone and KarMa viruses to date. The epidemiological and health-related consequences must be elucidated.

AB  - An on-going surveillance program on Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) in Iran has been launched since 2000. An outbreak of CCHF occurred in northern Iran between June and July 2015. Three cases were involved in this outbreak. One patient died after admission to hospital, and the others were treated successfully. Phylogenetic analysis showed that three sequences obtained from Iranian patients grouped within clade IV (Asia-1), clade V (Europe) and clade VI (Greece). The partial sequence of the strain Noshahr59 (KT588642) showed the highest similarity with other strains isolated from Russia, Kosovo and Turkey (Clade V, Europe). The genome sequence of the strain Chalous65 (KT588640) showed 100% homology to the strain AP29 isolated from Greece (DQ211638). The genome sequence of the strain Noshahr43 (KT588641) showed 88% similarity to the Pakistani and previously reported Iranian strains (AF527810, AJ538198, AY366379 and AY366373). These data support previous studies, which showed a distinct similarity between Iranian S segments of CCHFV strains with other strains within clade IV (Asia-1) and clade V (Europe). In addition, clade VI was detected for the first time in Iran. Moreover, strain Chalous65 with similar genetic characteristics to strain AP29 from Greece was isolated from a fatal human case.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a highly pathogenic tick-borne virus with a fatality rate of up to 50% in humans. CCHFV is widely distributed in countries around the world. Outbreaks of CCHFV infection in humans have occurred in prior years in Xinjiang Province, China. Epidemiological surveys have detected CCHFV RNA in ticks and animals; however, few isolates were identified. In this study, we identified and isolated a new CCHFV strain from Hyalomma asiaticum asiaticum ticks collected from north of Tarim Basin in Xinjiang, China. A preliminary investigation of infection and antigens expression of CCHFV was performed in newborn mice. The target tissues for CCHFV replication in newborn mice were identified. The analysis of the phylogenetic relationships with other Chinese strains suggested that diverse genotypes of CCHFV have circulated in Xinjiang for years. These findings provide important insights into our understanding of CCHFV infection and evolution as well as disease prevention and control for local residents.

AB  - Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne viral hemorrhagic fever disease which is known as an endemic disease within some provinces of Iran. Ticks play an important role in transmission of the disease. As vector and reservoir, ticks transmit CCHF virus from livestock to human. The current study reports the presence of CCHFV in Ghaemshahr county of Mazandaran province, in north of Iran based on the evidences obtained from ELISA and RT- PCR. Based on our results, IgG antibodies against CCHFV were detected in 4(4.8%) out of 84 sheep sera samples. Forty sera were obtained from people who were in close contact with the examined sheep, none of which had IgG antibodies against CCHFV. Using RT-PCR, we confirmed the existence of CCHFV genome in 1.7% of hard tick samples. Sequence analysis demonstrated that CCHFV genomes isolated from ticks were 100% identical to those isolated from the corresponding livestock. This study confirms the presence of the virus in this region; so people in close contact with livestock and health care workers should be alerted.

AB  - Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is one of the most severe viral zoonozes. It is prevalent throughout Africa, Asia and southern Europe. Limited availability of sequence data has hindered phylogeographic studies. The complete genomic sequence of all three segments of 14 Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus strains isolated from 1958-2000 in Russia, Central Asia and Africa was identified. Each genomic segment was independently subjected to continuous Bayesian phylogeographic analysis. The origin of each genomic segment was traced to Africa about 1,000-5,000 years ago. The virus was first introduced to South and Central Asia in the Middle Ages, and then spread to China, India and Russia. Reverse transfers of genomic segments from Asia to Africa were also observed. The European CCHFV genotype V was introduced to Europe via the Astrakhan region in South Russia 280-400 years ago and subsequently gradually spread westward in Russia, to Turkey and the Balkans less than 150 years ago. Only a few recombination events could be suggested in S and L genomic segments, while segment reassortment was very common. The median height of a non-reassortant phylogenetic tree node was 68-156 years. There were reassortment events within the European CCHFV lineage, but not with viruses from other locations. Therefore, CCHFV in Europe is a recently emerged zoonosis that represents a spillover from the global gene pool.

AB  - The trade-off hypothesis, the current paradigm of arbovirus evolution, proposes that cycling between vertebrate and invertebrate hosts presents significant constraints on genetic change of arboviruses. Studying these constraints in mosquito-borne viruses has led to a new understanding of epizootics. The trade-off hypothesis is assumed to be applicable to tick-borne viruses too, although studies are lacking. Tick-borne Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), a member of the family Bunyaviridae, is a major cause of severe human disease worldwide and shows an extraordinary amount of genetic diversity compared to other arboviruses, which has been linked to increased virulence and emergence in new environments. Using a transmission model for CCHFV, utilizing the main vector tick species and mice plus next generation sequencing, we detected a substantial number of consensus-level mutations in CCHFV recovered from ticks after only a single transstadial transmission, whereas none were detected in CCHFV obtained from the mammalian host. Furthermore, greater viral intra-host diversity was detected in the tick compared to the vertebrate host. Long-term association of CCHFV with its tick host for 1 year demonstrated mutations in the viral genome become fixed over time. These findings suggest that the trade-off hypothesis may not be accurate for all arboviruses.

AB  - This work represents the results of the genetic identification of the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHF virus) strains isolated in the Crimean Federal District in conducting the epidemiological survey of the imported case of CCHF from Crimea in 2015. One sample of the serum from a patient and 61 pools (506 specimens) of ticks collected during the epizootiological survey of 6 administrative districts of the Crimean Federal District were tested using PCR for the presence of the CCHF virus RNA. RNA of the CCHF virus was detected in serum from a patient and 10 samples of ticks. The genetic identification of the CCHF virus was performed by sequencing the virus genome S-, M-, and L-segments. The result of the molecular-genetic analysis revealed a high degree of identity between the samples of the CCHF virus in human serum and three samples of ticks and their belonging to a new genetic Crimea subclade (Vd) of the genotype Europe 1. Whole genome sequencing of two samples of CCHF virus belonging to the Crimea subgroup (Vd) was performed. CCHF virus variants of the Crimea subclade (Vd) of the Europe- lgenotype were described for the first time. These variants were endemic to the territory of the Crimean peninsula.

AB  - The Nairovirus genus of the Bunyaviridae family contains serious human and animal pathogens classified within multiple serogroups and species. Of these serogroups, the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) serogroup comprises sole members CCHFV and Hazara virus (HAZV). CCHFV is an emerging zoonotic virus that causes often-fatal hemorrhagic fever in infected humans for which preventative or therapeutic strategies are not available. In contrast, HAZV is nonpathogenic to humans and thus represents an excellent model to study aspects of CCHFV biology under conditions of more-accessible biological containment. The three RNA segments that form the nairovirus genome are encapsidated by the viral nucleocapsid protein (N) to form ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes that are substrates for RNA synthesis and packaging into virus particles. We used quantitative proteomics to identify cellular interaction partners of CCHFV N and identified robust interactions with cellular chaperones. These interactions were validated using immunological methods, and the specific interaction between native CCHFV N and cellular chaperones of the HSP70 family was confirmed during live CCHFV infection. Using infectious HAZV, we showed for the first time that the nairovirus N-HSP70 association was maintained within both infected cells and virus particles, where N is assembled as RNPs. Reduction of active HSP70 levels in cells by the use of small-molecule inhibitors significantly reduced HAZV titers, and a model for chaperone function in the context of high genetic variability is proposed. These results suggest that chaperones of the HSP70 family are required for nairovirus replication and thus represent a genetically stable cellular therapeutic target for preventing nairovirus-mediated disease. IMPORTANCE: Nairoviruses compose a group of human and animal viruses that are transmitted by ticks and associated with serious or fatal disease. One member is Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), which is responsible for fatal human disease and is recognized as an emerging threat within Europe in response to climate change. No preventative or therapeutic strategies against nairovirus-mediated disease are currently available. Here we show that the N protein of CCHFV and the related Hazara virus interact with a cellular protein, HSP70, during both the intracellular and extracellular stages of the virus life cycle. The use of inhibitors that block HSP70 function reduces virus titers by up to 1,000-fold, suggesting that this interaction is important within the context of the nairovirus life cycle and may represent a potent target for antinairovirus therapies against which the virus cannot easily develop resistance.

AB  - The presence of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) in Iran was assessed by collecting ticks from Golpayegan, Isfahan Province. Real time RT-PCR was used to detect the CCHFV RNA in the tick population and the origins of the viral sequences were determined. The CCHFV RNA was detected in 5.2% of 492 ticks collected from livestock in different regions of Golpayegan. The tick species that tested positive for the presence of CCHFV RNA included Hyalomma, Rhipicephalus and Haemaphysalis species. Phylogenetic analysis using the partial S-segment indicated that eight sequences clustered in clade IV (Asia-1) and three other sequences aligned within clade VI (Europe) with other CCHFV strains from Kosovo (Kosova1917) and Russia (Kashmanov).

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne human viral disease with fatality rate up to 30%. Two genetic lineages of CCHF virus (CCHFV) are present in Europe - lineage Europe 1 which contains pathogenic CCHFV strains, and lineage Europe 2 consisting of AP92 and AP92-like strains. In order to investigate CCHFV distribution and potential risk for humans, ticks were collected from livestock in the five districts where CCHF cases have been reported in the last five years in Bulgaria. CCHFV lineage Europe 1 was detected in 39 of 623 Hyalomma marginatum ticks (6.3%; range per village 2.7-15.2%), while CCHFV lineage Europe 2 was detected for the first time in Bulgaria in 49 of 415 Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato ticks (11.8%; range 0-58.3%). The present study shows that both Europe 1 and Europe 2 CCHFV lineages are present in Bulgaria. The pathogenic role of the AP92-like strains remains to be elucidated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a member of the Bunyaviridae family and Nairovirus genus. It has a negative-sense, single stranded RNA genome approximately 19.2 kb, containing the Small, Medium, and Large segments. CCHFVs are relatively divergent in their genome sequence and grouped in seven distinct clades based on S-segment sequence analysis and six clades based on M-segment sequences. Our aim was to obtain new insights into the molecular epidemiology of CCHFV in Iran. METHODS: We analyzed partial and complete nucleotide sequences of the S and M segments derived from 50 Iranian patients. The extracted RNA was amplified using one-step RT-PCR and then sequenced. The sequences were analyzed using Mega5 software. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis of partial S segment sequences demonstrated that clade IV-(Asia 1), clade IV-(Asia 2) and clade V-(Europe) accounted for 80 %, 4 % and 14 % of the circulating genomic variants of CCHFV in Iran respectively. However, one of the Iranian strains (Iran-Kerman/22) was associated with none of other sequences and formed a new clade (VII). The phylogenetic analysis of complete S-segment nucleotide sequences from selected Iranian CCHFV strains complemented with representative strains from GenBank revealed similar topology as partial sequences with eight major clusters. A partial M segment phylogeny positioned the Iranian strains in either association with clade III (Asia-Africa) or clade V (Europe). CONCLUSION: The phylogenetic analysis revealed subtle links between distant geographic locations, which we propose might originate either from international livestock trade or from long-distance carriage of CCHFV by infected ticks via bird migration.

METHODS: Samples were isolated from Iranian patients and those available in GenBank, and analyzed by phylogenetic and bootscan methods. RESULTS: Through comparison of the phylogenetic trees based on full length sequences and partial fragments in the S-segment genome of CCHFV, genetic switch was evident, due to recombination event. Moreover, evidence of multiple recombination events was detected in query isolates when bootscan analysis was used by SimPlot software. CONCLUSION: Switch of different genomic regions between different strains by recombination could contribute to CCHFV diversification and evolution. The occurrence of recombination in CCHFV has a critical impact on epidemiological investigations and vaccine design.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral zoonotic disease with potentially fatal systemic effects on man. We aimed to determine the presence of CCHF virus among collected ticks from domestic livestock from October 2012 to September 2013. METHODS: A total of 1245 hard and soft ticks were collected from naturally infested ruminants in Marvdasht County, Fars Province, south of Iran. Nine tick species and one unidentified species in four disparate genera were detected. A total of 200 ticks were randomly selected and analysed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the presence of CCHF virus genome. RESULTS: The viral genome was detected in 4.5% (9 samples) of the studied tick population. The infected ticks belonged to the species of Hyalomma marginatum' Hyalomma anatolicum and Rhipicephalus sanguineus. The viruses detected in these three tick species were clustered in the same lineage as Matin and SR3 strains in Pakistan and some other Iranian strains. These results indicate that the ticks were wildly infected with a genetically closely related CCHF virus in the region. CONCLUSION: Regular controls and monitoring of livestock to reduce the dispersion of ticks and providing information to those involved in high-risk occupations are urgently required.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is endemic in Bulgaria. During 2013-2014, 11 confirmed CCHF cases have been reported in the country (seven in 2013 and four in 2014). The present study provides the CCHF molecular epidemiology in Bulgaria based on all currently available S, M, and L RNA segment nucleotide sequences spanning the years 1978-2014. A relatively low genetic difference (0-6%, the maximum seen in the M RNA segment) was seen among the CCHFV sequences suggesting that a slow evolving CCHFV strain belonging to "Europe 1" clade is present in Bulgaria. Although the virus emerged in new foci during the recent years, it is more active in the established endemic foci which seem to offer the most suitable ecosystem and environment. Understanding the CCHF epidemiology and virus evolution is the basis for public health programs and vaccine design.

AB  - Recent events in West Africa have highlighted the potential for the viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) to cause considerable mortality and morbidity among heathcare workers. However, this is not a new threat as, although the risk is currently increased, it has always been present. In South Africa (SA) the only endemic haemorrhagic fever is Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, transmitted by the Hyalomma tick, which is ubiquitous in cattle farming areas. Johannesburg, the commercial and transport hub of SA, is unusual in that all cases of VHF seen there are imported, either from rural areas in SA or from countries to the north. Johannesburg functions as the gateway to and from the rest of Africa, and as a destination for more affluent residents of neighbouring countries seeking medical attention. Numerous outbreaks of nosocomial infection have occurred in SA, and these are described in the form of brief case reports.

AB  - Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever virus (CCHFV) is transmitted through the bite of an infected tick, or by direct contact with CCHFV-infected patients' blood or the products of infected livestock. In 2012, ticks were collected in eight regions of Lorestan Province, Iran. In total, 434 ticks were collected. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used for the detection of CCHFV RNA. Of 434 ticks, 419 (96.6%) ticks were from the family Ixodidae (hard ticks) and 15 (3.5%) ticks were from the family Argasidae (soft ticks). The presence of CCHFV RNA was detected in 29 (6.7%) of 434 ticks. The infected tick species include Hyalomma asiaticum (n = 7, 7.4%), Hyalomma anatolicum (n = 12, 13.2%), Hyalomma marginatum (n = 1, 16.7%), and Rhipicephalus sanguineus (n = 9, 4.3%). These empirical data demonstrated that the majority of CCHFV-positive ticks belonged to the Ixodidae. None of the Argasidae and Haemaphysalis sulcata species was infected with CCHFV. The phylogenetic analyses of the tick-derived CCHFV strains revealed that all 29 viral strains fell in clade IV (Asia 1). The most abundant species of tick collected in this study was R. sanguineus followed by different species of Hyalomma. Given the infection rate among collected ticks, H. marginatum was the most abundant infected tick species (16.7%) followed by H. anatolicum (13.2%), H. asiaticum (7.4%), and R. sanguineus (4.3%).

AB  - The genus Nairovirus of arthropod-borne bunyaviruses includes the important emerging human pathogen, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), as well as Nairobi sheep disease virus and many other poorly described viruses isolated from mammals, birds, and ticks. Here, we report genome sequence analysis of six nairoviruses: Thiafora virus (TFAV) that was isolated from a shrew in Senegal; Yogue (YOGV), Kasokero (KKOV), and Gossas (GOSV) viruses isolated from bats in Senegal and Uganda; Issyk-Kul virus (IKV) isolated from bats in Kyrgyzstan; and Keterah virus (KTRV) isolated from ticks infesting a bat in Malaysia. The S, M, and L genome segments of each virus were found to encode proteins corresponding to the nucleoprotein, polyglycoprotein, and polymerase protein of CCHFV. However, as observed in Leopards Hill virus (LPHV) and Erve virus (ERVV), polyglycoproteins encoded in the M segment lack sequences encoding the double-membrane-spanning CCHFV NSm protein. Amino acid sequence identities, complement-fixation tests, and phylogenetic analysis indicated that these viruses cluster into three groups comprising KKOV, YOGV, and LPHV from bats of the suborder Yingochiroptera; KTRV, IKV, and GOSV from bats of the suborder Yangochiroptera; and TFAV and ERVV from shrews (Soricomorpha: Soricidae). This reflects clade-specific host and vector associations that extend across the genus.

AB  - The nairoviruses include assorted tick-borne bunyaviruses that are emerging as causative agents of infectious diseases among humans and animals. As negative-sense single-stranded RNA (-ssRNA) viruses, nairoviruses encode nucleoprotein (NP) that encapsidates the genomic RNA and further forms ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex with viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We previously revealed that the monomeric NP encoded by Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) presents a racket-shaped structure and shows unusual DNA-specific endonuclease activity. To examine the structural and biological variation of nairovirus-encoded NPs, here, we systematically solved the crystal structures of NPs encoded by various nairoviruses, including Hazara virus (HAZV), Kupe virus (KUPV), and Erve virus (ERVEV). Combined with biochemical analysis, our results generate a clearer picture to aid in the understanding of the functional diversity of nairovirus-encoded NPs and the formation of nairovirus RNPs. IMPORTANCE: Nairoviruses comprise several tick-borne bunyaviruses that are emerging as causative agents of infectious diseases among humans and animals; however, little is known of the nairovirus genome assembly and transcription mechanisms. Based on the previous study of CCHFV NP reported by different research groups, we systematically investigate here the structural and functional diversity among three different nairoviruses. This work provides important information on nairovirus nucleoprotein function and the formation of RNPs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) has been reported from more than 30 countries in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe and Middle East. The disease is considered endemic in Pakistan and neighboring countries like Iran and Afghanistan. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the genetic diversity of CCHF virus (CCHFV) detected in Pakistan and Afghanistan based on analysis of partial S-segment sequences. STUDY DESIGN: During 2011, one hundred samples satisfying the CCHF case definition were tested by (ELISA) and RT-PCR for detection of IgM antibodies and viral RNA, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out on partial S-segment nucleotide sequences using MEGA 5.0. RESULTS: Out of one hundred collected during 2011, 49 (49%) were positive for CCHF either by ELISA/RT-PCR or both. The mean age of the CCHFV positive cases was 30.32 years (range 18-56 years) and overall mortality rate was 20.4%. All CCHF virus isolates from this study clustered with strains previously reported from Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan within the Asia-1 genogroup. Four distinct sub-clades were found circulating within Asia-1 genogroup. Six CCHFV strains found in Pakistan and Afghanistan grouped into a new sub-clade-D. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this study shows that endemic foci of CCHFV span the international border between Pakistan and Afghanistan with genetically diverse variants circulating in this region. Our findings emphasize to establish a laboratory based surveillance program and devise health policy measures to control CCHF infection especially in Baluchistan.

AB  - Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a negative-strand RNA virus of the family Bunyaviridae (genus: Nairovirus). In humans, CCHFV causes fever, hemorrhage, severe thrombocytopenia, and high fatality. A major impediment in precisely determining the basis of CCHFV's high pathogenicity has been the lack of methodology to produce recombinant CCHFV. We developed a reverse genetics system based on transfecting plasmids into BSR-T7/5 and Huh7 cells. In our system, bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase produced complementary RNA copies of the viral S, M, and L segments that were encapsidated with the support, in trans, of CCHFV nucleoprotein and L polymerase. The system was optimized to systematically recover high yields of infectious CCHFV. Additionally, we tested the ability of the system to produce specifically designed CCHFV mutants. The M segment encodes a polyprotein that is processed by host proprotein convertases (PCs), including the site-1 protease (S1P) and furin-like PCs. S1P and furin cleavages are necessary for producing the non-structural glycoprotein GP38, while S1P cleavage yields structural Gn. We studied the role of furin cleavage by rescuing a recombinant CCHFV encoding a virus glycoprotein precursor lacking a functional furin cleavage motif (RSKR mutated to ASKA). The ASKA mutation blocked glycoprotein precursor's maturation to GP38, and Gn precursor's maturation to Gn was slightly diminished. Furin cleavage was not essential for replication, as blocking furin cleavage resulted only in transient reduction of CCHFV titers, suggesting that either GP38 and/or decreased Gn maturation accounted for the reduced virion production. Our data demonstrate that nairoviruses can be produced by reverse genetics, and the utility of our system uncovered a function for furin cleavage. This viral rescue system could be further used to study the CCHFV replication cycle and facilitate the development of efficacious vaccines to counter this biological and public health threat.

AB  - Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a potentially fatal systemic viral disease in many parts of the world, including Iran. The nationwide incidence of human CCHF in endemic areas was 870 confirmed cases with 126 deaths (case fatality rate, CFR = 17.6 %) in the decade leading to 2012. The detection of the CCHF virus (CCHFV) genome in tick vectors is of fundamental importance for identifying these ticks as potential reservoirs of CCHFV infection. From May to October 2013, following detection of four new clinical cases resulting in two deaths in the city of Mashhad (northeast Iran), hard ticks were recovered from infested livestock in 40 villages in Khorasan-Razavi province and examined by the microscopic method for species identification. About a quarter of the ticks were then subjected to reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect the CCHFV genome. The PCR products were then sequenced, and their phylogenetic lineages were determined. A total of 407 hard ticks were captured, representing seven different species in two distinct genera. Members of the genus Hyalomma were widely distributed in all but two of the villages studied, and this was also the most frequent (83.3 %) tick genus. Of 105 adult ticks subjected to RT-PCR, four (3.8 %) ticks were found positive for the CCHFV genome. One brown ear tick, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus, was found to be naturally infected for the first time anywhere in the world. Ticks of Hyalomma asiaticum, Hyalomma marginatum, and Rhipicephalus turanicus were also found to be naturally infected with CCHFV. CCHFV found in these four different tick species were clustered in the same lineage with the Matin and SR3 strains from Pakistan and some other strains from Iran, indicating that these tick species were naturally infected with genetically closely related CCHFV in the region. The presence of CCHFV infection in four different hard tick species was confirmed using RT-PCR in northeast Iran. Part of this infection was attributed to Rh. appendiculatus, which is thus a potential new natural vector of CCHFV in Iran. It is also confirmed by phylogenetic analysis that CCHFV in this region is genetically closely related, even in the different tick species.

AB  - Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a member of the Bunyaviridae family with a tripartite, negative sense RNA genome. This study used predictive software to analyse the L (large), M (medium), and S (small) segments of 14 southern African CCHFV isolates. The OTU-like cysteine protease domain and the RdRp domain of the L segment are highly conserved among southern African CCHFV isolates. The M segment encodes the structural glycoproteins, GN and GC, and the non-structural glycoproteins which are post-translationally cleaved at highly conserved furin and subtilase SKI-1 cleavage sites. All of the sites previously identified were shown to be conserved among southern African CCHFV isolates. The heavily O-glycosylated N-terminal variable mucin-like domain of the M segment shows the highest sequence variability of the CCHFV proteins. Five transmembrane domains are predicted in the M segment polyprotein resulting in three regions internal to and three regions external to the membrane across the G(N), NS(M) and G(C) glycoproteins. The corroboration of conserved genome domains and sequence identity among geographically diverse isolates may assist in the identification of protein function and pathogenic mechanisms, as well as the identification of potential targets for antiviral therapy and vaccine design. As detailed functional studies are lacking for many of the CCHFV proteins, identification of functional domains by prediction of protein structure, and identification of amino acid level similarity to functionally characterised proteins of related viruses or viruses with similar pathogenic mechanisms are a necessary step for selection of areas for further study.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne zoonotic viral disease with a disease fatality rate between 15% and 70%. Despite the wide range of distribution, the virus (CCHFV) is basically endemic in Africa, Asia, eastern Europe, and the Middle East. Acute febrile illness associated with petechiae, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and multiple-organ failure are the main symptoms of the disease. With all these fatal effects, CCHFV is considered a huge threat as no successful therapeutic approach is currently available for the treatment of this disease. In the present study, we have used the immunoinformatics approach to design a potential epitope-based vaccine against the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase-L of CCHFV. Both the T-cell and B-cell epitopes were assessed, and the epitope "DCSSTPPDR" was found to be the most potential one, with 100% conservancy among all the strains of CCHFV. The epitope was also found to interact with both type I and II major histocompatibility complex molecules and is considered nonallergenic as well. In vivo study of our proposed peptide is advised for novel universal vaccine production, which might be an effective path to prevent CCHF disease.

AB  - Bats can carry important zoonotic pathogens. Here we use a combination of next-generation sequencing and classical virus isolation methods to identify novel nairoviruses from bats captured from a cave in Zambia. This nairovirus infection is highly prevalent among giant leaf-nosed bats, Hipposideros gigas (detected in samples from 16 individuals out of 38). Whole-genome analysis of three viral isolates (11SB17, 11SB19 and 11SB23) reveals a typical bunyavirus tri-segmented genome. The strains form a single phylogenetic clade that is divergent from other known nairoviruses, and are hereafter designated as Leopards Hill virus (LPHV). When i.p. injected into mice, the 11SB17 strain causes only slight body weight loss, whereas 11SB23 produces acute and lethal disease closely resembling that observed with Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever virus in humans. We believe that our LPHV mouse model will be useful for research on the pathogenesis of nairoviral haemorrhagic disease.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), a severe viral disease known to have occurred in over 30 countries and distinct regions, is caused by the tick-borne CCHF virus (CCHFV). Nucleocapsid protein (NP), which is encoded by the S gene, is the primary antigen detectable in infected cells. The goal of the present study was to map the minimal motifs of B-cell epitopes (BCEs) on NP. Five precise BCEs (E1, 247FDEAKK252; E2a, 254VEAL257; E2b, 258NGYLNKH264; E3, 267EVDKA271; and E4, 274DSMITN279) identified through the use of rabbit antiserum, and one BCE (E5, 258NGYL261) recognized using a mouse monoclonal antibody, were confirmed to be within the central region of NP and were partially represented among the predicted epitopes. Notably, the five BCEs identified using the rabbit sera were able to react with positive serum mixtures from five sheep which had been infected naturally with CCHFV. The multiple sequence alignment (MSA) revealed high conservation of the identified BCEs among ten CCHFV strains from different areas. Interestingly, the identified BCEs with only one residue variation can apparently be recognized by the positive sera of sheep naturally infected with CCHFV. Computer-generated three-dimensional structural models indicated that all the antigenic motifs are located on the surface of the NP stalk domain. This report represents the first identification and mapping of the minimal BCEs of CCHFV-NP along with an analysis of their primary and structural properties. Our identification of the minimal linear BCEs of CCHFV-NP may provide fundamental data for developing rapid diagnostic reagents and illuminating the pathogenic mechanism of CCHFV.

AB  - Full-length genomes of the Sakhalin virus (SAKH) and Paramushir virus (PRMV) (Sakhalin group, Nairovirus, Bunyaviridae) isolated from the ticks Ixodes uriae White 1852 were sequenced using the next-generation sequencing (Genbank ID: KF801659, KF801656). SAKV and PRMV have 81% identity for the part of RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) on the nucleotide level and 98.5% on the amino acid level. Full-length genome comparison shows that SAKV have, in average, from 25% (N-protein, S-segment) to 50% (RdRp, L-segment) similarity with the nairoviruses. The maximum value of the amino acid similarity (50.3% for RdRp) SAKV have with the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) and Dugbe virus (DUGV), which are also associated with the Ixodidae ticks. Another virus studied is Rukutama virus (RUKV) (isolated from ticks I. signatus Birulya, 1895) that recently was classified (based on morphology and antigenic reaction) to the Nairovirus genus, presumably to the Sakhalin group. In this work the genome of the RUKV was sequenced (KF892052-KF892054) and RUKV was classified as a member of the Uukuniemi group (Phlebovirus, Bunyaviridae). RUKV is closely related (93.0-95.5% similarity) with our previously described Komandory virus (KOMV). RUKV and KOMV form separate phylogenetic line neighbor of Manawa virus (MWAV) isolated from the ticks Argas abdussalami Hoogstraal et McCarthy, 1965 in Pakistan. The value of the similarity between RUCV and MWAV is 65-74% on the amino acid level.

AB  - Despite being a small country, Kosovo represents one of the few foci of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in Europe. The distribution of Kosovar tick vectors and the evolution of CCHF virus in ticks are both as yet unknown. A better description of the extent and the genetic diversity of CCHFV in ticks from endemic settings is essential, in order to be controlled. We investigated the 2012 distribution of Kosovar ticks alongside the prevalence and the phylogeography of tick-derived CCHFV. Hyalomma marginatum dominated in the endemic municipalities with 90.2% versus 24.3% in the non-endemic regions. Of 1,102 tested ticks, 40 (3.6%) were CCHFV-positive, belonging to H. marginatum (29), Rhipicephalus bursa (10), and Ixodes ricinus (1). The virus strains clustered with clade V and VI related sequences. They fell into two lineages: Kosovo I and II. Kosovo I comprised strains recovered exclusively from R. bursa ticks and was closely related to AP92 prototype strain. Kosovo II clustered into Kosovo IIa, including human-derived strains, and IIb including only strains detected in H. marginatum and I. ricinus. Our phylogeographic reconstruction suggests two temporally distinct CCHFV introductions: the most probable location of the most recent common ancestor of Kosovo I lineage was in Greece (63 years ago) and that of lineages IIa-b in Turkey (35 years ago). After each CCHFV introduction into Kosovo, subsequent lineage expansions suggest periods of in situ evolution. The study provides the first insight into the genetic variability and the origin of CCHFV in ticks from Kosovo. Our findings indicate the spreading of CCHFV to non-endemic areas, which underlines the importance of further studies in order to monitor and predict future CCHF outbreaks in Kosovo. The AP92-like strains appear to be more widespread than previously thought and may provide a promising target for experimental studies due to their assumed low pathogenicity.

AB  - Background. Targeted enrichment improves coverage of highly mutable viruses at low concentration in complex samples. Degenerate primers that anneal to conserved regions can facilitate amplification of divergent, low concentration variants, even when the strain present is unknown. Results. A tool for designing multiplex sets of degenerate sequencing primers to tile overlapping amplicons across multiple whole genomes is described. The new script, run_tiled_primers, is part of the PriMux software. Primers were designed for each segment of South American hemorrhagic fever viruses, tick-borne encephalitis, Henipaviruses, Arenaviruses, Filoviruses, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Rift Valley fever virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus. Each group is highly diverse with as little as 5% genome consensus. Primer sets were computationally checked for nontarget cross reactions against the NCBI nucleotide sequence database. Primers for murine hepatitis virus were demonstrated in the lab to specifically amplify selected genes from a laboratory cultured strain that had undergone extensive passage in vitro and in vivo. Conclusions. This software should help researchers design multiplex sets of primers for targeted whole genome enrichment prior to sequencing to obtain better coverage of low titer, divergent viruses. Applications include viral discovery from a complex background and improved sensitivity and coverage of rapidly evolving strains or variants in a gene family.

AB  - Ticks were collected from various regions of northern Greece and tested for the presence of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) RNA. Human and animal sera were collected in the regions where CCHFV-positive ticks were detected, and they were tested for the presence of IgG antibodies against the virus. A CCHFV strain was detected in Rhipicephalus bursa ticks collected from sheep in Kastoria regional unit, differing by 9.7% at the nucleotide level from the AP92 strain, which was isolated in 1975 in another region of Greece. Up to date, CCHF cases have not been reported in these regions. The human seroprevalence in the area was estimated at 6%, while IgG-positive sheep was detected in two of the four neighboring farms tested. The circulation of this specific CCHFV lineage in Greece, especially in a region where the seroprevalence is high, together with the lack of human CCHF cases, suggests a probable antigenic, but non- or low-pathogenic character of this lineage. Further studies on these strains will increase our knowledge about the role of AP92-like strains in the CCHF epidemiology, which might be useful for drug and vaccine design.

AB  - Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a bunyavirus with a single-stranded RNA genome consisting of three segments (S, M, L), coding for the nucleocapsid protein, envelope glycoproteins and RNA polymerase, respectively. To date only five complete genome sequences are available from southern African isolates. Complete genome sequences were generated for 10 southern African CCHFV isolates using next-generation sequencing techniques. The maximum-likelihood method was used to generate tree topologies for 15 southern African plus 26 geographically distinct complete sequences from GenBank. M segment reassortment was identified in 10/15 southern African isolates by incongruencies in grouping compared to the S and L segments. These reassortant M segments cluster with isolates from Asia/Middle East, while the S and L segments cluster with strains from South/West Africa. The CCHFV M segment shows a high level of genetic diversity, while the S and L segments appear to co-evolve. The reason for the high frequency of M segment reassortment is not known. It has previously been suggested that M segment reassortment results in a virus with high fitness but a clear role in increased pathogenicity has yet to be shown.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a zoonotic agent that causes severe, life-threatening disease, with a case fatality rate of 10-50%. It is the most widespread tick-borne virus in the world, with cases reported in Africa, Asia and Eastern Europe. CCHFV is a genetically diverse virus. Its genetic diversity is often correlated to its geographical origin. Genetic variability of CCHFV was determined within few endemic areas, however limited data is available for Kosovo. Furthermore, there is little information about the spatiotemporal genetic changes of CCHFV in endemic areas. Kosovo is an important endemic area for CCHFV. Cases were reported each year and the case-fatality rate is significantly higher compared to nearby regions. In this study, we wanted to examine the genetic variability of CCHFV obtained directly from CCHF-confirmed patients, hospitalized in Kosovo from 1991 to 2013. We sequenced partial S segment CCHFV nucleotide sequences from 89 patients. Our results show that several viral variants are present in Kosovo and that the genetic diversity is high in relation to the studied area. We also show that variants are mostly uniformly distributed throughout Kosovo and that limited evolutionary changes have occurred in 22 years. Our results also suggest the presence of a new distinct lineage within the European CCHF phylogenetic clade. Our study provide the largest number of CCHFV nucleotide sequences from patients in 22 year span in one endemic area.

Antigen and RNA of CCHF virus were detected in 3.4% of tick pools from Rudaki district using ELISA and RT-PCR tests. As of Tursunzade district, viral antigen was identified in 9.0% of samples and viral RNA was identified in 8.1% of samples. The multiple alignment of the obtained nucleotide sequences of CCHF virus genome S-segment 287-nt region (996-1282) and multiple alignment of deduced amino acid sequences of the samples, carried out to compare with CCHF virus strains from the GenBank database, as well as phylogenetic analysis, enabled us to conclude that Asia 1 and Asia 2 genotypes of CCHF virus are circulating in Tajikistan. It is important to note that the genotype Asia 1 virus was detected for the first time in Tajikistan.

AB  - Viral metagenomics characterizes known and identifies unknown viruses based on sequence similarities to any previously sequenced viral genomes. A metagenomics approach was used to identify virus sequences in Australian mosquitoes causing cytopathic effects in inoculated mammalian cell cultures. Sequence comparisons revealed strains of Liao Ning virus (Reovirus, Seadornavirus), previously detected only in China, livestock-infecting Stretch Lagoon virus (Reovirus, Orbivirus), two novel dimarhabdoviruses, named Beaumont and North Creek viruses, and two novel orthobunyaviruses, named Murrumbidgee and Salt Ash viruses. The novel virus proteomes diverged by ≥ 50% relative to their closest previously genetically characterized viral relatives. Deep sequencing also generated genomes of Warrego and Wallal viruses, orbiviruses linked to kangaroo blindness, whose genomes had not been fully characterized. This study highlights viral metagenomics in concert with traditional arbovirus surveillance to characterize known and new arboviruses in field-collected mosquitoes. Follow-up epidemiological studies are required to determine whether the novel viruses infect humans.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a zoonosis mainly transmitted by ticks that causes severe hemorrhagic fever and has a mortality rate of 5-60%. The first outbreak of CCHF occurred in the Crimean peninsula in 1944-45 and it has recently emerged in the Balkans and eastern Mediterranean. In order to reconstruct the origin and pathway of the worldwide dispersion of the virus at global and regional (eastern European) level, we investigated the phylogeography of the infection by analysing 121 publicly available CCHFV S gene sequences including two recently characterised Albanian isolates. The spatial and temporal phylogeny was reconstructed using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo approach, which estimated a mean evolutionary rate of 2.96 x 10(-4) (95%HPD=1.6 and 4.7 x 10(-4)) substitutions/site/year for the analysed fragment. All of the isolates segregated into seven highly significant clades that correspond to the known geographical clades: in particular the two new isolates from northern Albania clustered significantly within the Europe 1 clade. Our phylogeographical reconstruction suggests that the global CCHFV clades originated about one thousand years ago from a common ancestor probably located in Africa. The virus then spread to Asia in the XV century and entered Europe on at least two occasions: the first in the early 1800s, when a still circulating but less or non-pathogenic virus emerged in Greece and Turkey, and the second in the early 1900s, when a pathogenic CCHFV strain began to spread in eastern Europe. The most probable location for the origin of this European clade 1 was Russia, but Turkey played a central role in spreading the virus throughout Europe. Given the close proximity of the infected areas, our data suggest that the movement of wild and domestic ungulates from endemic areas was probably the main cause of the dissemination of the virus in eastern Europe.

AB  - Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a tick-borne virus with high pathogenicity to humans. CCHFV contains a three-segment [small (S), medium (M) and large (L)] genome and is prone to reassortment. Investigation of identified reassortment events can yield insight into the evolutionary history of the virus, while migration events reflect its geographical dissemination. While many studies have already considered these issues, they have investigated small numbers of isolates and lack statistical support for their findings. Here, we consider a larger set of 30 full genomes to investigate reassortment using recombination methods, as well as two sets of partial S segments comprising 393 isolates, reflecting a broader geographical range, to investigate migration events. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the S segment showed strong geographical subdivision, but this was less apparent in the M and L segments. A total of 16 reassortment events with 22 isolates were identified with strong statistical support. Migration analysis on the partial S segments identified both long- and short-range migration events that spanned the entire geographical region in which the CCHFV has been isolated, reflecting the complex processes associated with the dissemination of the virus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a virulent tick-borne disease reported in more than 30 countries across Europe, Africa, and Asia. The disease is considered endemic in several Central Asian countries, including Tajikistan; however reports of human cases from these regions rarely reach the West. METHODS: We analyzed all historical confirmed cases of CCHF in Tajikistan, mapping these reports against geographic data to assess risk areas. In addition, comprehensive analysis was undertaken on the 2010 human CCHF cohort to demonstrate effective methodologies for diagnosing this disease in-country. RESULTS: These data show that CCHF is endemic in Tajikistan, and several large clusters have been recorded. Endemic foci of disease are localized to the southern region, with geographical factors such as altitude, monthly mean temperature, and monthly mean precipitation levels limiting establishment of tick vectors in other areas. Genomic analysis of viral RNA from a 2010 human case revealed high nucleotide homology (99%) to a strain isolated in Tajikistan in 1990. CONCLUSIONS: CCHF is an important vector-borne and nosocomial pathogen in Tajikistan. The ability to rapidly detect cases using real-time RT-PCR shortly after admission in the hospital setting allows prompt implementation of barrier nursing techniques, therefore reducing onward transmission of the virus.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is a viral infection that is caused by Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV). On May 27, 2012, a woman became ill after accidentally splashing cow's blood into her eyes. Serological and molecular investigations were carried out on the serum of the patient. The test results for serological testing were negative, but RT-PCR was strongly positive for CCHFV. A phylogenetic study on the CCHFV genome sequence showed 50 % similarity to a 520-bp region of Russian strains. By combining historical phylogenetic data and current data, it can be surmised that there are potentially more than five circulating CCHFV genomic variants in Iran.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), which is widely distributed in parts of Asia, Africa and Europe, often causes fatal viral infections in humans. However, its evolutionary features are still unclear. In this study, a total of 22 global CCHFV strains with complete genome segments were analysed. Three medium (M) segment reassortants and two small (S) segment reassortants were newly identified. According to Bayesian analysis of the S, M and large (L) segment datasets with and without reassortants, inclusion of reassortants was approved to bias Bayesian analysis of the S and L segments, but not the M segment. The mucin domain of the M segment had no effect on evolutionary rate estimates, but had slight effects on the time to the most recent common ancestor. Selection pressure analysis suggested that CCHFV was under strong purifying selection regardless of the S, M and L segments, and that the L segment was also shaped by positive selection. Bayesian analysis in this study indicated the evolutionary features of CCHFV, which were helpful in investigating the molecular evolution, CCHF surveillance and the pathogenicity of CCHFV and other viruses in the family Bunyaviridae.

AB  - Several haemorrhagic fevers are caused by highly pathogenic viruses that must be handled in Biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) containment. These zoonotic infections have an important impact on public health and the development of a rapid and differential diagnosis in case of outbreak in risk areas represents a critical priority. We have demonstrated the potential of a DNA resequencing microarray (PathogenID v2.0) for this purpose. The microarray was first validated in vitro using supernatants of cells infected with prototype strains from five different families of BSL-4 viruses (e.g. families Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Filoviridae, Flaviviridae and Paramyxoviridae). RNA was amplified based on isothermal amplification by Phi29 polymerase before hybridization. We were able to detect and characterize Nipah virus and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) in the brains of experimentally infected animals. CCHFV was finally used as a paradigm for epidemics because of recent outbreaks in Turkey, Kosovo and Iran. Viral variants present in human sera were characterized by BLASTN analysis. Sensitivity was estimated to be 10(5) -10(6) PFU/mL of hybridized cDNA. Detection specificity was limited to viral sequences having ~13-14% of global divergence with the tiled sequence, or stretches of ~20 identical nucleotides. These results highlight the benefits of using the PathogenID v2.0 resequencing microarray to characterize geographical variants in the follow-up of haemorrhagic fever epidemics; to manage patients and protect communities; and in cases of bioterrorism.

AB  - A nosocomial outbreak of Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) was reported among humans in Ahmadabad district, Gujarat, India during January, 2011. In the present study we provide the complete genomic sequences of four CCHFV isolates derived from two human patients and two pools of Hyalomma anatolicum ticks during the period of this outbreak and the complete S segment sequence of two retrospective human serum samples, positive for CCHFV in 2010. Sequence-based molecular characterization of the Indian CCHFV showed that they possessed the functional motifs known to occur in the S, M and L gene segment products as in other CCHF viruses. The S segment of the six Indian CCHF viruses showed 99.8% nucleotide identity. Notably both tick isolates shared 100% nucleotide identity with one of the Indian human isolates of 2011. Phylogenetic analysis based on the S segment demonstrated that the Indian CCHFV isolates formed a distinct cluster in the Asian-Middle East group IV of CCHF viruses. The S segment was closest to a Tajikistan strain TADJ/HU8966 of 1990 (98.5% nucleotide identity) and was of South-Asia 2 type while the M segment was of type M2. Both M and L segments were closest to an Afghanistan strain Afg09-2990 of 2009 (93% and 98% nucleotide identity, respectively). The Indian isolates were thus identified as a South-Asia 2/M2 far-east virus combination and the differing parental origin in the S and L/M segments is suggestive that it may be an intra-genotypic reassortant. Molecular clock studies further revealed that the ancestry of the viruses was not very recent and dated back to about 33years on the basis of the S segment while it was about 15years based on the M segment. Thus though the 2011 outbreak may not have resulted from a very recent introduction, considering that so far there is no evidence of multiple circulating strains in the country, the possibility of a recent re-introduction of the virus from any of the neighboring countries cannot be ruled out. The study thus warrants the need for continued surveillance and increased sampling of CCHFV in different parts of the country.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is an important zoonotic viral disease that is asymptomatic in infected livestock, but poses a serious threat to humans. The high fatality rate may be due to phylogenetic variations in the virus, transmission routes, and a lack of an efficient surveillance system for the disease. The geographical features of the eastern and southeastern borders of Turkey may facilitate transmission of viruses between countries of the region. Therefore in this study we focused on the genetic relationship between Turkish and Iranian CCHF viruses based on their S-segment sequences. The research was performed on a total of 104 blood samples from small ruminants reared in southwest Iran. The results of phylogenetic analysis showed that Iranian CCHF virus isolates were closely related to human-originating Turkish Group II viruses from a European lineage reported previously.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne zoonosis which is common in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Balkan Peninsula. CCHF has been reported in Turkey with high frequency since 2002. The aim of the present study was to investigate the genetic diversity and genetic relationship between CCHF virus (CCHFV) isolates derived from infected patients over a 2-year period (2009 and 2010) in several provinces of Turkey. Serum samples (n = 48) were selected from CCHFV RNA positive patients and subjected to sequence analysis of the gene regions encoding the S (48 samples) and M (14 samples) segments. The nucleotide sequence alignments showed that the nucleic acid relatedness of CCHFV isolates ranged from 95.7% to 100% and from 93.7% to 100% for S and M segments, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of both segment sequences revealed that CCHFV isolates circulating in Turkey belonged to the European lineage I and were closely related to the viruses found in the Eastern European-Russian and Balkan Peninsula. The M gene segment-based phylogenetic analysis suggested that 2/14 CCHFV isolates (KYSR3159/09 and YZGT714/10) had additional genetic variations. The results of the present study confirmed that the CCHFV isolates present in Turkey associated with human disease had high genetic homology in S segment, but some variability in the M segment of the RNA.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a severe illness with high fatality. Cases are reported in several countries in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Phylogenetic analyses based on the virus S (nucleocapsid), M (glycoprotein), and L (polymerase) genome segments sequences indicate distinct geographic lineages exist but their specific genetic characteristics require elucidation. In this work we collected all full length S segment sequences and generated a phylogenetic tree based on the alignment of these 62 samples. We then analyzed the alignment using entries from AAIndex, the Amino Acid Index database, to identify amino acid mutations that performed significant changes in charge, pka, hydropathy and side chain volume. Finally, we mapped these changes back to the tree and alignment to identify correlated mutations or sites that characterized a specific lineage. Based on this analysis we are able to propose a number of sites that appear to be important for virus function and which would be good candidates for experimental mutational analysis studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) activity has recently been detected in the Kordufan region of Sudan. Since 2008, several sporadic cases and nosocomial outbreaks associated with high case-fatality have been reported in villages and rural hospitals in the region. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present study, we describe a cluster of cases occurring in June 2009 in Dunkop village, Abyei District, South Kordufan, Sudan. Seven CCHF cases were involved in the outbreak; however, clinical specimens could be collected from only two patients, both of whom were confirmed as acute CCHF cases using CCHF-specific reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Phylogenetic analysis of the complete S, M, and L segment sequences places the Abyei strain of CCHF virus in Group III, a virus group containing strains from various countries across Africa, including Sudan, South Africa, Mauritania, and Nigeria. The Abyei strain detected in 2009 is genetically distinct from the recently described 2008 Sudanese CCHF virus strains (Al-fulah 3 and 4), and the Abyei strain S and L segments closely match those of CCHF virus strain ArD39554 from Mauritania. CONCLUSIONS: The present investigation illustrates that multiple CCHF virus lineages are circulating in the Kordufan region of Sudan and are associated with recent outbreaks of the disease occurring during 2008-2009.

AB  - The paper describes a simple, rapid screening of samples potentially containing Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus strains, by applying the restriction analysis of amplicones, for the differentiation of CCHF virus genotypes that are characteristic of Europe from virus biovariants uncharacteristic of this area, this technique requiring no sequence at the first stage. For this screening, the authors propose to use the PCR fragment of CCHF L segment that comprises a variable region, as well as Alul and Haelll restriction endonucleases. The screening scheme proposed for samples potentially containing CCHF virus may aid investigators to monitor in order to detect uncharacteristic genotypic virus variants in the Russian Federation and other European countries.

AB  - Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a viral zoonotic disease with a high mortality rate in humans. The CCHF virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of Ixodid ticks or contact with blood or tissues of CCHF patients or infected livestock. In December 2008, a re-emerging outbreak of CCHF occurred in the southern part of Iran. Five people were hospitalised with sudden fever and haemorrhaging, and CCHF was confirmed by RT-PCR and serological assays. One of the cases had a fulminant course and died. Livestock was identified as the source of infection; all animals in the incriminated herd were serologically analysed and more than half of them were positive for CCHFV. We demonstrated that two routes of transmission played a role in this outbreak: contact with tissue and blood of infected livestock, and nosocomial transmission. Phylogenetic analyses helped to identify the origin of this transmission. This outbreak should be considered as a warning for the national CCHF surveillance system to avoid further outbreaks through robust prevention and control programmes.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is viral hemorrhagic fever caused by CCHF virus, which belongs to the family Bunyaviridae and the genus Nairovirus. The virus is transmitted to humans via contact with blood and tissue from infected livestock, a tick bite, or contact with an infected person. Since 2000, we have shown the disease to be prevalent in 23 out of 30 provinces of Iran. Among those, Sistan-va-Baluchistan, Isfahan, Fars, Tehran, Khorasan, and Khuzestan demonstrated the highest infection, respectively. Notably, Sistan-va-Baluchistan province, southeast of Iran, has the highest prevalence of CCHF, and has shown to be present since at least 2000. Phylogenetic study of the CCHF virus genome isolated from Iranian patients showed a close relationship with the CCHF Matin strain (Pakistan). Our epidemiological data in the last decade have implied that the severity and fatality rate of the disease has ranged variably in different provinces of Iran. More pathogenesis and phylogenetic studies should therefore be investigated to clarify these differences.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne viral zoonosis distributed widely in Africa, Asia, Russia and the Balkans. Occurrence of segment reassortment has been established and may be associated with pathogenicity. The ability to distinguish between an infection with a reassortant and a non-reassortant variant may have prognostic value. In this study the use of Simple-Probe technology and real-time PCR was investigated to detect rapidly CCHF viral nucleic acid and to distinguish between reassorted and non-reassorted variants of southern African CCHF virus (CCHFV) isolates. A Simple-Probe was designed based on multiple alignments of 19 CCHFV partial M segment sequences that included reassorted and non-reassorted isolates from two phylogenies. Real-time PCR followed by probe-specific melting-curve analysis allowed differentiation of three selected isolates representative of two phylogenetically distinct groups, SPU 431/85 (group IV), 383/87 (group IV) and 103/87 (group III) based on melting temperatures. Within group IV there are two distinct lineages which were represented in the optimization. A further 16 clinical isolates could be genotyped into groups III and IV using the Simple-Probe real-time PCR assay developed in this study. This assay provides a reliable and sensitive tool for the differentiation between reassorted and non-reassorted variants of CCHFV which finds application for diagnosis and epidemiologic and surveillance studies.

AB  - As a first line of defence against a virus infection, mammalian cells elicit an innate immune response, characterized by secretion of type I interferons (IFN) and up-regulation of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). We have previously included Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus (CCHFV) in the list of type I IFN-sensitive viruses. In this in vitro study, we have compared the antiviral activity of two recombinant IFN-alpha preparations (Roferon A and Intron A) with a natural IFN-alpha produced in human leukocytes (Multiferon). Our results clearly demonstrate that these commercially available IFNs have significant antiviral activities against CCHFV. However, we could show that Multiferon inhibits viral replication more efficiently than the two recombinant IFN alpha preparations.

The study was performed on a total of 48 confirmed human CCHF cases from 2006 to 2008. The majority of the CCHF viral strains in Turkey were found to belong to the European lineage. Local CCHF viral strains are grouped into two main clusters, which can be further divided into two sub-groups. We also identified an AP92-like virus causing clinical disease in Corum (a mid-Anatolian province). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the most recent CCHFV infections were caused by intrinsic (or native) CCHF viral strains, which we identified as the local topotype. Comparison of deduced amino acid sequences of S-segment RNAs indicated that the local topotype was derived from viruses of previous years, most likely by a low rate recombination. No genetic differences, based on S- and M-segment RNA sequences, were found between human and tick viral isolates. This data suggest that replication of CCHFV in the tick vector, whether Rhiphicephalus spp. or Hyalomma spp., has no effect on the viral genomic structure.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is the causative agent of a tick-borne disease with high mortality rates in humans. The distribution of CCHFV includes over 30 countries in Asia, the Middle East, southeastern Europe, and Africa. It was first recognized in Turkey in 2002, with an increasing number of cases reported between 2002 and 2009. Recent analysis of complete genome sequences of CCHFV isolates has revealed that the genomic plasticity of the virus is surprisingly high for an arthropod-borne virus. We have determined the complete nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of strain CCHFV Turkey-Kelkit06 isolated from the blood of a patient in an endemic region of Turkey in 2006. The complete sequence length of the CCHFV Turkey-Kelkit06 strain is 19,186 nt, consisting of a 1673 nt S segment, a 5364 nt M segment, and a 12,149 nt L segment. Based on the analysis of S, M, and L segments, CCHFV Turkey-Kelkit06 clustered in Group V, which represents the Europe/Turkey geographic lineage. Although glycoproteins encoded by the M gene are the most variable part of the CCHFV Turkey-Kelkit06 strain, some functional domains of the glycoproteins are well conserved. Here, we report the complete sequence and genome organization of the CCHFV Turkey-Kelkit06 strain and its phylogenetic relationship to other strains of CCHFV. Collecting data on viral sequences among isolates from CCHF epidemics may provide valuable information regarding the molecular basis of the epidemic potential of the virus.

AB  - In 2004 and 2005, an epidemiological survey of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) was conducted in Xinjiang, China. A total of 5,629 serum samples of human and livestock were collected and tested for the CCHFV antibody, and 17,319 ticks were collected for viral identification. Reverse passive hemagglutination inhibition assays showed that the average prevalence of CCHFV antibody was 1.7% for the humans and 12.7% for the livestock. A relatively high antibody prevalence, ranging from 19.1% to 23.4%, was found in the livestock of the northwest, southwest, and northeast parts of the Tarim Basin. When the ticks were pooled to inoculate suckling mice, followed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) to detect CCHFV RNA, the average RT-PCR-positive rates for Hyalomma asiaticum kozlovi and H. asiaticum asiaticum were 12.9% and 2.6%, respectively. A significant correlation was found between the antibody prevalence in the livestock and the CCHFV prevalence in H. asiaticum of the same geographic region. No CCHFV RNA was detected in Dermacentor nivenus, Rhipicephalus turanius, or Rhipicephalus sanguineus. A total of 27 partial S segments of CCHFVs were sequenced and used for phylogeny analysis. All but one Chinese isolate grouped into the Asia 1 clade, which contains the strains from Xinjiang and Uzbekistan, while the other strain, Fub90009, grouped with strains from the Middle East.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is a fatal infection, but no clinical case due to AP92 strain was reported. We described the first clinical case due to AP92 like CCHFV. METHODS: A case infected by a AP92 like CCHFV was detected in Balkanian part of Turkey. Diagnosis was confirmed by RT-PCR and sequencing. A human serologic and tick survey studies were performed in the region, where the case detected. RESULTS: Thirty eight individuals out of 741 were found to be anti CCHFV IgM positive. The attack rate for overall CCHFV was calculated as 5.2%. In univariate analyses, CCHFV IgM positivity was found to be associated with the age (p < 0.001), male gender (p = 0.001), agricultural activity (p = 0.036), and history of tick bite (p = 0.014). In multivariate analysis, older age (OR: 1.03, CI:1.01-1.05, p < 0.001), male gender were found to be the risk factors (OR: 2.5, CI:1.15-5.63, p = 0.020) for CCHFV infection. CONCLUSION: This is the first human case with AP92 like CCHFV infection. Furthermore, this is the first report of AP92 like strain in Turkey. In the region, elderly males carry the highest risk for CCHFV infection.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is endemic in Albania. Ticks collected from cattle grazing in the endemic areas of Albania were tested for presence of CCHFV RNA, while serum samples collected from goats, cattle, hares, and birds were tested for the presence of specific IgG antibodies to CCHFV. One of the 31 pools prepared, consisting of four female Hyalomma spp. ticks, was found to carry CCHFV RNA with 99.2-100% homology to sequences detected in patients from the same region. Antibodies were not detected in cattle, hares, and birds, but 2/10 goats presented high titers of IgG antibodies. The shepherd of that flock was a member of a family affected by CCHF 10 days before the collection of goats' sera, and he presented a mild form of the disease.

AB  - Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a tick-borne viral zoonosis widely distributed in Africa, Asia and eastern Europe. Reassortment of CCHF genome segments has been shown to occur in nature. We therefore investigated the genetic relationship of southern African isolates using partial sequence data for each RNA segment, S, M and L, and comparing the tree topologies constructed using a neighbour joining method. A total of 21 southern African isolates were studied. The incongruencies which were identified in S, M and L sequence datasets involved group switching implying reassortment for 15 isolates. A higher fatality rate occurred in patients infected with isolates which had apparently acquired M segments from a group in which predominantly Asian strains are usually found. This suggests that reassortment may affect the pathogenicity of the virus.

AB  - The Balkan region and Kosovo in particular, is a well-known Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) endemic region, with frequent epidemic outbreaks and sporadic cases occurring with a hospitalized case fatality of approximately 30%. Recent analysis of complete genome sequences of diverse CCHF virus strains showed that the genome plasticity of the virus is surprisingly high for an arthropod-borne virus. High levels of nucleotide and amino acid differences, frequent RNA segment reassortment and even RNA recombination have been recently described. This diversity illustrates the need to determine the complete genome sequence of CCHF virus representatives of all geographically distinct endemic areas, particularly in light of the high pathogenicity of the virus and its listing as a potential bioterrorism threat. Here we describe the first complete CCHF virus genome sequence of a virus (strain Kosova Hoti) isolated from a hemorrhagic fever case in the Balkans. This virus strain was isolated from a fatal CCHF case, and passaged only twice on Vero E6 cells prior to sequence analysis. The virus total genome was found to be 19.2 kb in length, consisting of a 1672 nucleotide (nt) S segment, a 5364 nt M segment and a 12150 nt L segment. Phylogenetic analysis of CCHF virus complete genomes placed the Kosova Hoti strain in the Europe/Turkey group, with highest similarity seen with Russian isolates. The virus M segments are the most diverse with up to 31 and 27% differences seen at the nt and amino acid levels, and even 1.9% amino acid difference found between the Kosova Hoti and another strain from Kosovo (9553-01). This suggests that distinct virus strains can coexist in highly endemic areas.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus is member of the genus Nairovirus of the family Bunyaviridae. All members of the family Bunyaviridae are enveloped viruses containing tripartite, negative polarity, single-stranded RNA. CCHF is characterized by high case mortality, occurring in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Europe. During recent years, outbreaks have been reported in Turkey. However, little information is available on the genetic diversity of CCHF virus in Turkey. In this study, a total of 1227 adult ticks were collected from domestic ruminants (796 specimens from cattle, 399 specimens from goats and 32 specimens from sheep). The presence of the M segment of CCHF virus was determined in 4 of 40 (10%) Hyalomma marginatum marginatum pools, in 2 of 38 (7.89%) Rhipicephalus bursa pools, and in 1 of 7 (7%) Boophylus annulatus pools. Hyalomma anatolicum anatolicum pools gave negative RT-PCR result against CCHF virus. Serum samples from seven patients infected with CCHF were selected and subjected to RT-PCR to amplify partial M segment of CCHF virus. This report introduces the first data on partial nucleotide sequences of M RNA segments of CCHF virus strains circulating in Turkey, isolated from ticks.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the molecular characteristics of 3 Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses(CCHFV) isolated in Xinjiang province. METHODS: YL05035, YT05099 and LT05146 were isolated in 2005 from Hyalomma ticks and viral RNA was extracted from suckling mouse brains infected with these three strains respectively. The polymerase chain reaction(PCR) products of S segments from the 3 strains of CCHFV were directly sequenced. RESULTS: The full-length'S RNA from the 3 strains of CCHFV all comprised 1673 nucleotides with ORF of them including 1449 nucleotides and encoding a protein which comprised 482 amino acids in a viral complementary sense. The sequences indicated that the three strains of CCHFV isolated from ticks in Xinjiang province were highly homologenic. Data from the phylogenetic analysis showed that the obtained sequences were identical. The homology between 3 strains of CCHFV was 99.5%. Their homologies compared with that of the other strains isolated from other region of Xinjiang were also high at nucleotide levels (92.7%-99.8%). The three strains which were clustered together with 7001 strain and 79121 strain (isolated from patient and rat in Xinjiang respectively) was only different by 2%-3%. The genetic difference from the prototype CCHFV Nigerian strain IBAR10200 was 13%. In comparison, the Nigerian CCHFV tick isolate was more divergent when compared with the reference China strains 66019 and with the three variants mentioned above. CONCLUSION: The CCHFV isolated from China comprised a group of genetically high conserved strains.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a tick-borne virus in the family Bunyaviridae, genus Nairovirus. The virus is transmitted to humans through infected tick bites or from direct contact with viremic animals or humans. In the present study, a total of 1,015 adult ticks were collected from cattle (603 specimens), sheep (17 specimens), and goats (395 specimens) in the Kelkit Valley in Turkey. Four tick species were recognized on the animals in the surveyed region. The most abundant species were Rhipicephalus bursa and Hyalomma marginatum marginatum, at 47.68% (484/1,015) and 46.40% (471/1,015), respectively. Reverse transcriptase PCR was used to recover partial sequences of the CCHFV small (S) genome segment. The presence of CCHFV was determined in 3 of 33 (9.09%) R. bursa pools and in 1 of 31 (3.22%) H. m. marginatum pools. Virus sequences from R. bursa were extremely different from those of the Greek CCHFV strain (U04958) isolated from an R. bursa tick. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the CCHFV isolates obtained in this study clustered in group 5, whose range encompasses southwestern Russian and Kosovo. This is the first evidence of CCHFV in ticks from Turkey. Even though Hyalomma is the main vector for CCHFV, R. bursa may play a role in CCHFV transmission.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a severe illness with high case fatality that occurs in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. The complete genomes of 13 geographically and temporally diverse virus strains were determined, and CCHF viruses were found to be highly variable with 20 and 8%, 31 and 27%, and 22 and 10% nucleotide and deduced amino acid differences detected among virus S (nucleocapsid), M (glycoprotein), and L (polymerase) genome segments, respectively. Distinct geographic lineages exist, but with multiple exceptions indicative of long-distance virus movement. Discrepancies among the virus S, M, and L phylogenetic tree topologies document multiple RNA segment reassortment events. An analysis of individual segment datasets suggests genetic recombination also occurs. For an arthropod-borne virus, the genomic plasticity of CCHF virus is surprisingly high.

AB  - S-segment nucleotide sequences for two Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus strains isolated in the Rostov Region of Russia and in Bulgaria have been determined. Analysis of complete S-segment nucleotide sequences in the viral strains from different regions of the world has established that the CCHF virus strains isolated from ticks and human beings in different southern Russian regions in 1967 and 2000 are very closely genetically and they form an individual subgroup in the basic European genetic group. By the S-segment structure, the CCHF virus strain isolated in Bulgaria in 1978 belongs to the same genetic group as a representative of its second subgroup. Analysis of the S-segment 3'-noncoding region suggests that the CCHF virus circulating in Europe, Central Asia, and China may have originated from one global focus of infection, including several CCHF virus genovariants. During evolution, fragmental exchange apparently occurred in the S-segment 3'-noncoding region as a result of homological recombination.

AB  - The complete genomic sequence (minus primer-generated ends) of the laboratory-adapted Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) strain ROS/HUVLV-100, isolated in 2003 from the blood of a deceased female from the Rostov region of southern European Russia, was determined by direct sequencing of overlapping reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction amplified products. The size of the ROS/HUVLV-100 genome is 19.2 kilobases--individual genome segments are similar in size and sequence features to previously reported "Europe-1" group CCHFV strains. The low-passage ROS/HUVLV-100 strain is the first Russian Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus isolate for which complete sequence information is available, and this work reports the first complete genomic CCHFV sequence determined from a single viral RNA preparation in the same laboratory.

AB  - Blood specimens obtained from 32 CCHF patients were tested for the presence of CCHF virus markers. In addition, 3210 ticks of the genera Hyalomma asiaticum, Hyalomma anatolicum, and Dermacentor niveus were examined to identify the CCHF virus antigen and RNA. This material was obtained during the 2001-2003 local outbreaks of CCHF in Kazakhstan and Tajikistan. The nucleotide sequence in the region 983-1282 of S segment of the CCHF virus for 12 wild type strains was determined. The phylogenetic relationships among the established biovariants of CCHF virus, and also between these biovariants and those from other regions of the world were identified. We were the first to demonstrate the presence of an African-like genotype of CCHF virus in the territory of Kazakhstan. The conclusion was made that two genotypes of CCHF virus were in circulation in Kazakhstan. It was also demonstrated that CCHF virus, circulating in the territories of Kazakhstan and Tajikistan, was genetically heterogeneous.

METHODS: The S partial segment from the patient and tick samples collected in 2001 and 2002 was tested by RT-PCR, the positive samples were sequenced directly. The nucleotide homology of S partial segment as well as the whole segments were analyzed and the phylogenetic tree of S and M gene segments was drawn by computer. RESULTS: All compared sequences of S partial segments from the patient and tick samples showed a high homology of nucleotide sequences. Phylogenetic tree divided all the analyzed viruses into three groups; Europe, African and Asian group. The Asian group can be divided further into another two branches: the middle Asian branch and the Chinese branch. All the Chinese isolates were clustered into one single group and was easy to be discriminated from the other isolates. The dividing of M segments seemed not completely related to the geographic origin of the viruses. CONCLUSION: M segment classification was not consistent to the geographic distribution of the viruses. S segments analysis showed the close relationship of genetic background between the patient isolates and the tick isolates. Besides, all the Chinese isolates have the common evolution route and the gene structure characteristics displayed the regional distribution pattern.

AB  - Alignment of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) L genome segment full-length sequences reveals an overall high level of conservation among strains, with greater than 90% of translated amino acid residues strictly conserved. However, a region of marked variability identified previously, corresponding to L polyprotein amino acid positions 760-810, shares only 40% overall identity between strains. The variable regions sequences of 16 laboratory-adapted CCHFV strains were determined, including 11 strains from European Russia, one strain from Bulgaria, and four strains from the Central Asian countries of Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates this L segment variable region sequence divides CCHFV strains into similar geographically-defined groupings observed for S segment-derived trees, but with higher bootstrap support and a much smaller character set required for analysis.

AB  - The genus Nairovirus of the family Bunyaviridae includes the Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) species group. The species is predominated by the hazard-group 4 pathogens, from which the name and majority of strain entries are derived. Additionally, the species embraces hazard-group 2 viruses that are classified as members by antigenic cross-reactivity. CCHF viruses have a tripartite RNA genome consisting of large (L), medium (M) and small (S) segments. Here, the sequence characterization of previously undescribed L and S segments from novel strains originating in the Middle East and Africa is reported. Further scrutiny of this data with phylogenetic tools, in the context of other publicly available sequence information, reveals analogous grouping patterns between the L and S segments. These groups correlate with the geographical distribution of strain isolation and indicate that the L and S segments of CCHF viruses have evolved together.

AB  - The large (L) RNA segment of Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus strain AST/TI30908, isolated from pooled Hyalomma marginatum ticks collected in 2002 from the Astrakhan region of European Russia, was amplified piecemeal using reverse-transcription/polymerase chain reaction, followed by direct sequencing of gel-purified amplicons. After removal of 5' and 3' primer-generated termini, the assembled AST/TI30908 L segment sequence is 12112 nucleotides long, with 41.3% G + C content, and is greater than 87% and 96% identical at the nucleotide and translated amino acid levels, respectively, to partial or full-length CCHF virus L segment sequences deposited in GenBank. A complete L segment coding-region sequence for CCHF virus strain TAJ/HU8966, isolated from a patient in Tajikistan in 1990, was determined in a similar fashion. This L segment (12133 nucleotides long, 41.1% G + C content) shares 88% nucleotide identity with the full-length strain Matin from Pakistan, and 97% nucleotide identity with a partial L segment sequence of strain Khodzha from Uzbekistan. Strain TAJ/HU8966 shares at least 96% identity at the translated amino acid level with all other CCHF virus L segment sequences. Although, for the most part, CCHF virus L polyprotein primary sequences are uniformly well conserved, a region of marked variability was identified in the N-terminal half of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. This region, approximately 50 amino acids in length, is flanked by previously-reported arenavirus and bunyavirus-conserved regions, and may prove useful in CCHF diagnosis and viral taxonomy.

AB  - Phylogenetic relationships were examined for 70 Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) isolates from southern, central and West Africa, the Middle East and Greece using sequence data determined for a region of the S segment of the genome. Analysis revealed up to 18% genetic differences. Tree topology supports previous evidence for the existence of three groups of genetically related isolates, A, B and C. Within group A there are two clades: an African clade and a predominantly Asian clade comprising isolates from Pakistan, China, Iran, Russia and Madagascar. Group B includes isolates from southern and West Africa and Iran, and group C includes a single isolate from Greece. Despite the potential which exists for dispersal of the virus between Africa and Eurasia, it appears that circulation of the virus is largely compartmentalized within the two land masses, and the inference is that the geographic distribution of phylogenetic groups is related to the distribution and dispersal of tick vectors of the virus.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Four patients with typical acute viral hemorrhagic fever were identified in the holy city of Makkah, Saudi Arabia, between 8 and 23 February 2001, the Hajj (pilgrimage) period of that year. Tests for Rift Valley fever (RVF), Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), and dengue were negative. Blood specimens were sent to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta for viral culture and testing for other hemorrhagic fever viruses. A new flavivirus closely related to the tick-borne Kyasanur forest disease virus was isolated. This new flavivirus was originally isolated in 1995 from 6 patients with dengue-like hemorrhagic fever from Alkhumra district, south of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: A case definition was formulated for surveillance of this new disease in Saudi Arabia. Blood specimens were collected from all patients with suspect 'Alkhumra' virus (ALKV) infection and tested for ALKV, RVF, CCHF, dengue, and West Nile encephalitis. Patients data were prospectively collected on standardized data collection forms. RESULTS: From 8 February 2001 through 9 February 2003, a total of 37 cases were identified in Makkah, 20 of them were laboratory confirmed. Acute febrile flu-like illness with hepatitis (100%), hemorrhagic manifestations (55%), and encephalitis (20%) were the main clinical features. The case fatality was 25%. The disease seemed to be transmitted from sheep or goat to humans by the mosquito bites or direct contact with these animals. CONCLUSIONS: ALKV infection is a novel serious zoonotic hemorrhagic fever virus discovered in Saudi Arabia. The role of arthropods such as ticks and mosquitoes, and animals such as sheep, goat, and rodents in the transmission and maintenance of the virus remains to be elucidated.

TI  - Evidence for recombination in Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus.
AU  - Lukashev AN
PY  - 2005
PD  - Aug
AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus has attracted considerable attention recently and a number of phylogenetic studies have been published, based mostly on partial sequences of S and M RNA segments. In this study, available full-length S, M and L segment sequences of CCHF virus were checked for recombination. Similarity plots and bootscan analysis of the S segment suggested multiple recombination events between southern European, Asian and African CCHF virus strains, with additional evidence provided by phylogenetic trees, the hidden Markov model and probabilistic divergence measures methods. No unambiguous signs of recombination were observed for M and L segments; however, the results did not exclude the possibility of this. These findings, coupled with a recent report on reassortment in CCHF virus, suggest caution when assessing CCHF virus phylogeny based on short sequence fragments.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus causes one of the most severe diseases in humans, with a mortality rate of up to 30%. It is transmitted to humans by the bite of hard ticks or by contact with blood or tissues from human patients or infected livestock. Balkan Peninsula is an endemic region of the disease, and sporadic cases or even outbreaks are observed every year. The M RNA segment encodes for the glycoprotein precursor of two surface glycoproteins Gn and Gc. Up to now complete M RNA CCHF virus sequences have been published from strains isolated in Nigeria, China, Pakistan, Tajikistan, and Russia. In the present study, the genetic characterization of the complete nucleotide sequence of the M RNA segment of a Balkan CCHF virus strain, Kosovo/9553/2001, isolated in summer of 2001 from a human fatal case in Kosovo is reported. This is the first published complete M nucleotide sequence of a CCHF virus strain isolated in Balkans. It was found that the Balkan strain is similar to the Russian strain, both strains differing from all other completely sequenced CCHF virus strains by approximately 22% at the nucleotide level forming an independent clade in the phylogenetic tree.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a severe zoonosis with a high fatality rate. In Russia, local CCHF outbreaks have occurred in the Stavropol Territory, and the Volgograd and Astrakhan Regions during 2000 and 2001. Seven strains of CCHF virus (CCHFV) were isolated from infected patients and collected ticks. Two fragments of the CCHF virus M genome segment were PCR amplified and their nucleotide sequences were determined. All these virus strains appear to be closely related (up to 5.8% nucleotide sequence differences) and form a distinct clade on the CCHFV phylogenetic tree. Within this clade, CCHFV strains from Stavropol and Astrakhan cluster together, whereas those from Volgograd form a separate subgroup.

AB  - The complete nucleotide sequences of the small (S) and medium (M) segments of three independent strains of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus isolated in Uzbekistan, Iraq and Pakistan have been determined. Partial S and M segment sequences from two additional strains and partial large segment sequences from five strains of CCHF virus have also been obtained. These data have been compiled and compared with published full-length and partial sequences of other CCHF virus strains. Analysis of virus strains for which complete and partial S and M segment sequences are available reveals that the phylogenetic grouping of some strains differ between these two segments. Data provided in this report suggest that this discrepancy is not the result of recombination, but rather the consequence of reassortment events that have occurred in some virus lineages. Although described in other genera of the Bunyaviridae family, this is the first report of segment reassortment occurring in the Nairovirus genus.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a potentially fatal disease caused by a tick-borne virus in the family Bunyavridae. The disease occurs in parts of Africa, Asia, Middle East, and Eastern Europe. During recent years, an increasing number of human CCHF cases have been diagnosed in Iran, but very little information is available on the prevalence and genetic diversity of CCHFV in Iran. In the present study, CCHF virus (CCHFV) isolates from nine Iranian patients infected during 2002 were examined genetically. Nucleotide sequencing of the S- and M-segments, encoding the nucleocapsid protein (NP) and the glycoproteins, respectively, revealed that the different isolates were related closely to each other with nucleotide sequence identities exceeding 98% for both S- and M-segments. Phylogenetic analysis of partial S-segment nucleotide sequences showed that the viruses clustered along with strains from Pakistan and Madagascar in one distinct lineage. Phylogenetic analysis also demonstrated that the Iranian isolates examined in this study and the previously published CCHFV strain ArTeh193-3 clustered into different genetic groups, indicating that at least two genetic lineages of CCHFV could be co-circulating in Iran.

AB  - The case of a child with Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) presumably infected with CCHF virus from her 27-year-old mother is described. The mother with CCHF was treated with ribavirin and did not present with any symptoms of obvious hemorrhage. The child developed fever on the 5th day after the mother's onset. The partial virus genome was amplified by RT-PCR, and nested PCR from the child and the genome sequence were identical to that from the mother, indicating possible transmission of the virus from mother to child. This case indicates the importance of preventive measures for in-house outbreaks of CCHF.

AB  - Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFv) is a member of the genus Nairovirus in the family Bunyaviridae. It possesses a tripartite, single stranded RNA genome of negative polarity consisting of large (L), medium (M) and small (S) segments. CCHF virus is enzootic in life stock and wild animals in many parts of the Middle East, Asia and Africa and is also recognised in Southeast Europe. Severe disease, manifest as haemorrhagic fever and high mortality rates (up to 50%), is only recognised in humans. We have determined the complete sequence of the small genomic RNA segment from several strains of CCHF virus from outbreaks in Pakistan 2000, Baghdad 1976 and Uzbekistan 1967. Phylogenetic analysis of three datasets of sequences from the small genomic RNA segment available from a range of strains indicates that they can be divided into seven subtypes. Superimposed on this pattern are links between distant geographic locations, pointing to the existence of a global reservoir of CCHFv. In some cases these links may originate from trade in livestock, and long-distance carriage of virus or infected ticks during bird migration.

AB  - Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus is highly pathogenic for humans and remains the only Category A virus for which full sequence information is currently unavailable. In this study we completed CCHF genome characterization by determining the L segment sequence using Dugbe and CCHF virus-specific oligonucleotides. Sequence alignments revealed the presence of four previously described conserved regions in all Bunyaviridae polymerases. Interestingly, additional regions containing putative Ovarian Tumor (OTU)-like cysteine protease and helicase domains were identified in the L segments of CCHF and Dugbe viruses, suggesting an autoproteolytic cleavage process for nairovirus L proteins.

AB  - The data on the structure of the M genome segment of CCHF virus strains from Russia and Central Asia (Tajikistan) are presented. Data obtained have been compared with other available published sequences of the middle segment of strains from China, Nigeria, and Pakistan. It has been found that all the known strains can be divided into four genetic groups, based on the nucleotide sequence of the M genome segment and an amino acid sequence of the glycoprotein precursor it encodes, whereas VLG/TI29414 and STV/HU29223 strains from Russia form a separate group. The CCHF virus strain from Tajikistan, TADJ/HU8966, was genetically related to strains 7803 and 75024 from China, and together with these and the Nigerian IbAr 10200 strain, it forms another group.

AB  - The genus Nairovirus (family Bunyaviridae) contains seven serogroups consisting of 34 predominantly tick-borne viruses, including several associated with severe human and livestock diseases [e.g., Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) and Nairobi sheep disease (NSD), respectively]. Before this report, no comparative genetic studies or molecular detection assays had been developed for this virus genus. To characterize at least one representative from each of the seven serogroups, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) primers targeting the L polymerase-encoding region of the RNA genome of these viruses were successfully designed based on conserved amino acid motifs present in the predicted catalytic core region. Sequence analysis showed the nairoviruses to be a highly diverse group, exhibiting up to 39.4% and 46.0% nucleotide and amino acid identity differences, respectively. Virus genetic relationships correlated well with serologic groupings and with tick host associations. Hosts of these viruses include both the hard (family Ixodidae) and soft (family Argasidae) ticks. Virus phylogenetic analysis reveals two major monophyletic groups: hard tick and soft tick-vectored viruses. In addition, viruses vectored by Ornithodoros, Carios, and Argas genera ticks also form three separate monophyletic lineages. The striking similarities between tick and nairovirus phylogenies are consistent with possible coevolution of the viruses and their tick hosts. Fossil and phylogenetic data placing the hard tick-soft tick divergence between 120 and 92 million years ago suggest an ancient origin for viruses of the genus Nairovirus.

AB  - Complete S-segment nucleotide sequences of genomic RNA were determined for two Crimea-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus strains, i.e. LEIV 10145 Uz isolated from ticks in Uzbekistan, 1985, and LEIV 29223 Stv isolated from a patient in Stavropol region, 2000. It was established that the S-segment length is 1672 and 1674 nucleotides. Therefore, the initiating codon (for methionine) is located at positions 56-58; the length of translation frames for the nucleocapsid protein is 482 amino acid residues. Distinctions in the length of S-segment, as compared to other strains, are related only with the 5' and 3' non-coding regions. A comparison of the nucleotide and amino-acid sequences of S-segments of genome of the mentioned strains with the early published data showed that the CCHF virus strain isolated in Uzbekistan is mostly close to strains isolated in China, and that the strain isolated in Stavropol region forms, jointly with Drozdov strain isolated in the Astrakhan region, a separate branch in the phylogenetic tree.

AB  - Hyalomma marginatum ticks (449 pools, 4787 ticks in total) collected in European Russia and Dermacentor niveus ticks (100 pools, 1100 ticks in total) collected in Kazakhstan were screened by ELISA for the presence of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV). Virus antigen was found in 10.2 and 3.0 % of the pools, respectively. RT-PCR was used to recover partial sequences of the CCHFV small (S) genome segment from seven pools of antigen-positive H. marginatum ticks, one pool of D. niveus ticks, four CCFH cases and four laboratory virus strains. Additionally, the entire S genome segments of the CCHFV strains STV/HU29223 (isolated from a patient in European Russia) and TI10145 (isolated from H. asiaticum in Uzbekistan) were amplified, cloned and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis placed all CCHFV sequences from Russia in a single, well-supported clade (nucleotide sequence diversity up to 3.2 %). Virus sequences from H. marginatum were closely related or identical to those recovered from patients in the same regions of southern Russia. Newly described CCHFV strains from Central Asian countries fell into two genetic lineages. The first lineage was novel and included closely related virus sequences from Kazakhstan and Tajikistan (nucleotide sequence diversity up to 3.2 %). In contrast, a newly described CCHFV strain from Uzbekistan, strain TI10145, clustered on the phylogenetic trees with strains from China.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between the structure and function at molecular level and the routes of transmission of Xinjiang hemorrhagic fever (XHF) virus. METHODS: S genes of five XHF virus strains were cloned, sequenced and compared with that of other Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus strains. RESULTS: It was found that S genes of the five viruses had 1,672 nuclei tides, while ORF of them including 1,449 nuclei tides and coded with a protein of 482 amino acid. The nucleotides homology of Chinese isolates (93.0%-99.5%) was obviously higher than that of any other S genes strains identified in other countries'. Phylogenetic tree showed that all Chinese isolates clustered into one branch and could be further divided into another three groups. CONCLUSION: The sequential difference of S genes was not totally related to the host, areas and time of the viruses isolated.

AB  - Genetic analysis of wild-type Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus strains recovered in the European part of Russia was performed. Reverse transcriptase PCR followed by direct sequencing was used to recover partial sequences of the CCHF virus medium (M) genome segment (M segment) from four pools of Hyalomma marginatum ticks and six human patients. Phylogenetic analysis of the M-segment sequences from Russian strains revealed a close relatedness of the strains (nucleotide sequence diversity, <or=5.0%). The strains differed significantly from CCHF viruses from other regions of the world (nucleotide sequence diversity, 10.3 to 20.4%), suggesting that CCHF virus strains recovered in the European part of Russia form a distinct group.

The epidemiological investigation, the clinical presentation of the cases, and the course of the disease are described. Seven of the cases were laboratory confirmed. A nosocomial infection and a cluster of cases within a family were observed. Genetic analysis of the CCHF virus strain that caused the outbreak showed that it was clustered together with other European CCHF virus strains except the Greek one (strain AP92). The Greek strain, which forms an independent clade, differed from the causative strain by 25.3% at the nucleotide level.

Comparison of nucleotide sequences of fragments of CCHF virus genome S segment and phylogenetic analysis of Russian strains showed that all CCHF strains isolated from humans and H. marginatum circulating in Russia were closely related and differed essentially from CCHF variants from other regions. Strains isolated in Uzbekistan and Tadjikistan were most closely related to CCHF strains from China.

AB  - The complete nucleotide sequences of the medium (M) segment of seven Chinese isolates of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus were determined. The M-segment RNA of CCHF virus comprises 5356-5377 nucleotides depending on the isolate and encodes a protein comprising 1689-1697 amino acids in a viral complementary sense. Phylogenetic analysis of the M segment showed that the Chinese CCHF virus isolates were clustered into three groups, one of which was more closely related to a Nigerian isolate. Pairwise comparison of a precursor protein showed that amino-terminal regions comprising 250 amino acids were extraordinary heterogeneous, with a 22.4% identity in amino acids being observed between the most distantly related isolates. Since all the viruses were isolated from 1966 to 1988 within a restricted area in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region in western China, the results indicate that a multisource virus population is endemic in this region.

AB  - We report the genetic characterization of the M RNA segment of Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV). Two CCHFV strains isolated in Xinjiang Province, a region endemic for CCHF in northwestern China, were studied. These strains, designated BA66019 and BA8402, were isolated in 1965 and 1984 from a CCHF patient and Hyalomma ticks, respectively. Viral RNA was extracted from suckling mouse brains infected with these two strains, amplified, and sequenced. The full-length M RNA, consisting of 5.3 kb, was determined for both strains. The coding nucleotide sequences of the two strains differed from each other by 17.5% and from the reference CCHFV strain IbAr10200 by a mean of 22%, suggesting that the genus Nairovirus comprises a group of genetically highly diverse strains.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the complete sequences of glycoprotein (M) gene of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) Chinese isolates (Xinjiang hemorrhagic fever virus, XHFV) BA66019, BA8402 BA88166 and to compare and analyze the relationships among the viruses. METHODS: Based on the conserved reverse complementarity of the CCHFV genomic termini, a primer PCM-Tag was designed and used together with random hexmers to initiate reverse transcription of viral RNA to synthesize cDNA. The latter was amplified with single primer PCM-Tag using the proof-reading DNA polymerase to produce the complete M gene. The PCR products were gel-purified and the whole M segment was sequenced and the comparison and analysis were performed aided by computer for the phylogenesis and coding strategy. RESULTS: Comparison of the whole M gene sequences of XHFV reference strain BA66019 with international prototype CCHFV IbAr10200 showed an excess of 5 base pairs in length, resulting in 5,365 bp; while BA8402 and BA8816 are 5,365 bp long, 4 more base pairs than IbAr10200. The first start codons of long ORFs were located at the 78th base pair in M gene of BA66019, BA8402 and BA88166, which were 15 base pairs prior to that of IbAr10200. The precursors encoded by these M genes were totaled 1,689 amino acids (AA), 6 AAs more than that of IbAr10200. The similaries between CCHFV M genes in nucleotide level were: 80.9% (IbAr10200-BA66019), 80.2% (IbAr10200-BA8402), 80.2% (IbAr10200-BA88166), 83.7% (BA8402-BA66019), 83.6% (BA88166-BA66019), and 99.0% (BA8402-BA88166), respectively. The corresponding similarities in amino acid level were 85.1%, 86.3%, 86.6%, 87.8%, 88.0%, and 98.8%, respectively. The similarities of M genes of CCHFVs and Dugbe virus in both nucleotide and amino acid levels were around 55% and 37%, which were much lower than those among CCHFVs. CONCLUSION: The M genes of XHFVs and IbAr10200 formed respective independent phylogenetic branches genetically and the human-origin isolate BA88166 might be a variant of tick-borne BA8402, suggesting that there was only one kind virus prevailing in Xinjiang epidemic areas in 1980s.

AB  - The S RNA segments of the nairoviruses Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) virus (Chinese isolate) and Hazara (HAZ) virus were cloned and sequenced from PCR products. The RNAs comprise 1672 and 1677 nucleotides, respectively, and each encodes a protein in the viral complementary strand (54.0 and 54.2 kDa, respectively). The deduced protein sequences show homology to each other and to the nucleoprotein of Dugbe (DUG) nairovirus, although both the CCHF and HAZ viral proteins are larger. Alignment of the nucleoprotein sequences of CCHF, HAZ, and DUG viruses show that the CCHF and HAZ sequences are somewhat more closely related to each other (60.0% identity) than either is to the DUG sequence (55.4 and 53.0% identity, respectively); 39.5% of residues are identical across all three proteins. The carboxyl-terminus of DUG N protein shows a 40-residue deletion relative to the N proteins of the other two viruses.

AB  - Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a rare disease in South Africa. From 1981 to September 1984, 8 sporadic primary cases were reported. An outbreak of CCHF in a large university hospital is described; of 8 patients diagnosed 2 died (the index and a secondary case). Four patients were seriously ill and 2 had a mild illness. Problems were encountered in diagnosing the disease, which presents initially with influenza-like symptoms, differing only in severity from influenza. However, petechiae and other manifestations of a bleeding tendency distinguished it from influenza in the later phase of the disease. Special investigations, especially those revealing leucopenia and thrombocytopenia, were critically important in early diagnosis. The dilemma of handling this highly contagious disease is that definite virological diagnosis is time-consuming and is conducted in only one high-security laboratory 1600 km distant. A further case was admitted 3 months later from a different locality and confirmed virologically but no secondary cases could be confirmed or traced.

The disease was fatal in the index and 1 secondary case, and was confirmed in the index and 6 secondary cases by isolation of the virus. An antibody response was demonstrated in the remaining patient, thought to be a tertiary case, but the fact that the patient received immune plasma therapy raises doubts about the validity of the diagnosis. The index case had contact with ticks and horses but his infection could not be related to a specific incident.

AB  - Analyses of the viral ribonucleic acids and structural polypeptides of 17-22 of the 119 accepted or proposed members of the Bunyavirus genus of arboviruses (family Bunyaviridae), have shown that from the standpoint of their structural components these viruses are highly comparable to each other. The average molecular weights for the three viral RNA species (L, large, M, medium, S, small) of 17 bunyaviruses were 2.93 X 10(6) (L, range 2.7-3.1 X 10(6)), 2.0 X 10(6) (M, range 1.8-2.3 X 10(6)), and 0.435 X 10(6) (Sm range 0.28-0.50 X 10(6)). The average molecular weights of the three major virion polypeptides (glycoproteins G1 and G2, and nucleocapsid protein, N) of 22 bunyaviruses were 115 X 10(3) (G1, range 108-120 X 10(3)), 37 X 10(3) (G2, range 20-41 X 10(3)) and 22 X 10(3) (N, range 19-25 X 10(3)). These results indicate that the structural components of bunyaviruses are different from those reported for Phlebotomus fever, Uukuniemi, and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and other members of the Bunyaviridae family that are not currently assigned to a genus.

AB  - This paper describes the clinical, epidemiological, and laboratory investigations undertaken to isolate and identify the etiological agent of a nosocomial cluster of hemorrhagic fever cases due to Crimean hemorrhagic fever (CHR)-Congo virus. Since this virus is usually transmitted by ticks it was surprising that the index case, in a nomadic shepherd, occurred during the winter season when ticks are relatively inactive. These are the first cases of CHF-Congo virus found in humans in Pakistan. Investigations on other biological properties, particularly strain differences and virulence, are being continued at the Islamabad laboratory.
