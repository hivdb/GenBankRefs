The "remote disconnected" error in GitHub Desktop can be caused by a variety of issues unrelated to your Internet connection. Here are some troubleshooting steps you can try to resolve it:

1. Check Repository Permissions
Ensure that you have the proper permissions to access the repository.
If itâ€™s a private repository, verify that your authentication (e.g., OAuth token or SSH key) is correctly configured.
2. Re-authenticate in GitHub Desktop
Open GitHub Desktop, go to File > Options > Accounts (on Mac: GitHub Desktop > Preferences > Accounts).
Sign out, then sign back in with your GitHub credentials to refresh the authentication token.
3. Check GitHub Status
Visit GitHub's status page to ensure there are no ongoing issues affecting the platform.
4. Update GitHub Desktop
Ensure you are using the latest version of GitHub Desktop. Outdated versions may cause connectivity issues.
Go to Help > About GitHub Desktop to check the version, and update if necessary.
5. Clear Cache and Restart GitHub Desktop
Close GitHub Desktop.
Navigate to the local cache directory:
On Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/GitHub Desktop/
On Windows: %APPDATA%\GitHub Desktop\
Delete the cache files, then restart GitHub Desktop.
6. Test with Command Line Git
Open a terminal and try the following commands:
bash
Copy code
git remote -v
git fetch origin
If you encounter issues here, it indicates the problem might be with Git settings or network configuration.
7. Check for Firewall/Antivirus Restrictions
Some firewalls or antivirus software might block GitHub Desktop or its network requests. Temporarily disable them to test if this resolves the issue.
8. Switch from HTTPS to SSH (or vice versa)
If your remote URL is HTTPS, try switching to SSH or vice versa:
HTTPS:
bash
Copy code
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
SSH:
bash
Copy code
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repository.git
9. Remove and Re-add the Repository in GitHub Desktop
In GitHub Desktop, go to Repository > Remove.
Re-clone the repository from GitHub using File > Clone Repository.
10. Check Network Proxies or VPNs
If you are behind a proxy or using a VPN, try disabling them to see if the issue persists.
